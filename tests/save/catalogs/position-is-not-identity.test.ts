/**
 * Array position is not save index, and these catalogs prove it.
 *
 * `WORKSHOP_IMPORT_CATALOG` carries Wall Rebuild (index 47) at array position
 * 34. Fourteen consecutive rows are therefore offset, and until 2026-08-18
 * `findWorkshopCatalogRow` subscripted the array directly — so save index 34
 * (Cash Bonus) returned Wall Rebuild, 35 returned Cash Bonus, and so on. Every
 * answer was a real workshop upgrade with a real level, which is why nothing
 * looked broken.
 *
 * Two claims are tested, and the second matters more than the first:
 *
 *   1. every finder resolves by identity
 *   2. AT LEAST ONE catalog is not dense-and-ordered
 *
 * Without (2) this whole file passes vacuously the moment someone sorts the
 * data, and the finders could quietly go back to being positional.
