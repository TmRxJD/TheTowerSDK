/**
 * The package against NanaSeiYuri's dissonance sheet.
 *
 * Most community guides cannot be checked — they describe how to play, and there is nothing to
 * compare a strategy to. This one states arithmetic: the boost caps, the wave the maximum is
 * reached at, how Echo sums over the other tiers, and the totals those produce. All of it is
 * computed here independently, from the game's own formula.
 *
 * So this is two checks at once, and either direction failing is worth knowing. If the package
 * drifts, a widely-used community reference disagrees with it. If the sheet is wrong, a lot of
 * players are planning against the wrong numbers.
 *
 * As of v28.0.3 they agree exactly, which is the strongest thing that can be said for either.
