/**
 * The cooldown sync floors, checked against the stone chart.
 *
 * Three of these were carried as `unverified` wiki claims: the seconds Black
 * Hole, Death Wave and Golden Tower reach at maximum stones. They are not
 * unverifiable — the stone chart is shipped data this package already owns and
 * prices every cooldown level. They are now derived from it.
 *
 * The literals below are the point of the test. `COOLDOWN_SYNC_TARGETS` reads
 * the chart, so comparing it to the chart again would restate the
 * implementation and pass forever. These are the wiki's numbers, written out,
 * so the test fails if either source moves.
