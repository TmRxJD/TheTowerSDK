    // FORMULA mode before it was cited -- see `effective-paths-ehp-plan.ts`.

    //   eDamage Keys!DW5  the vault Damage node's ROI -- the only keys
    //                     candidate priced on a local ladder rather than
    //                     against $DI5, and the reason the port never bought it
    //   eRegen!AL3        `={eHP!AL3:BM37}`, the mirror that makes the regen
    //   eHP!AL3           config readable from the eHP cells
    //   eRegen!BO4        header of eRegen's OWN level band, which the mirror
    //                     above does not reach
    // 131 -> 132 on 2026-08-22: `eDamage!CX6`, `(1+$BL$39)*(1+$BM$39)`. The
    // config used to read that finished product, which froze the vault out of
    // the keys planner; the compute now rebuilds it from the relic and the
    // level. Cited so the cell is findable after the field was deleted.
    // 132 -> 133 on 2026-08-22: `eDamage!BM39`, the ultimate weapon damage
    // vault. It reaches the weapons only through the `CX6` product, so the
    // compute divides that product by it to let a keys purchase move the term.
    // 157 -> 154 on 2026-08-30: the v29 EP extraction revised the cited-cell set
    // (net -3). sheets.v1.json was re-seeded from the current planner citations
    // (distinctEpPlannerCellKeys), the same scan cell-references pins at 154.
