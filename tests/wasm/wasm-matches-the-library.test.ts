/**
 * The WASM build has to answer the same as the library it is a build of.
 *
 * A port that drifts is the reason this exists at all — the alternative to shipping a WASM module
 * was other people re-implementing the numbers in their own language, which guarantees two
 * versions that disagree. A module that quietly disagrees with the TypeScript is that same failure
 * wearing this project's name.
 *
 * It is not theoretical. QuickJS inside Javy has no ICU, so `toLocaleString` returned the digits
 * ungrouped: `formatGroupedNumber(4770477147914)` gave '4770477147914' in the module and
 * '4,770,477,147,914' in Node. Both look like a number. Nothing would have reported it.
 *
 * These tests skip when the module has not been built (`npm run wasm:build`), because it is a
 * build artifact and not everyone needs one — but a built module that disagrees fails.
 */
/*
 * The module is built to `wasm/.build`, which is not where this file lives.
 *
 * This resolved `.build` from the test's OWN directory. That was the same directory until the
 * suite moved to `tests/`, after which it looked in `tests/wasm/.build`, found nothing, and
 * skipped every case — reporting nine skips rather than a broken path. A parity suite that skips
 * is indistinguishable from one that passes, which is the whole reason it exists.
