/**
 * A count the package can supply must never be typed into a sentence.
 *
 * `site-claims-are-true.test.ts` checked that the numerals were right. That is the weaker half of
 * the problem: it catches a number after it has gone wrong, and only when the claim is phrased the
 * way its pattern expects. It missed `'formulas': 822` in a code sample entirely, because the
 * number came after the noun rather than before it.
 *
 * The counts are now read from the installed package through `src/lib/sdk-facts.ts`, the same way
 * `SDK_VERSION` already was after that drifted twice. So the rule this file enforces is the one
 * that removes the question rather than policing it: if a fact exists, the page interpolates it.
 *
 * ## Which package the numbers describe
 *
 * The site installs `thetowersdk` from the registry with its own lockfile, so these numbers are
 * the PUBLISHED package's, not the working tree's. That is correct for a documentation site — a
 * reader installs what the site describes — and the release pipeline's `consumers` phase bumps the
 * site onto each new version, so the prose follows a publish without anyone editing it.
 *
 * It also means the site can legitimately differ from the working tree between releases. This file
 * therefore checks the SHAPE of the claim, never its value; `site-claims-are-true` owns value.
