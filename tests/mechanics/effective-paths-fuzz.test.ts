/**
 * Random accounts, not chosen ones.
 *
 * ## What this adds
 *
 * Every other test here picks its account: a zero, a midpoint, three profiles
 * along a curve. Chosen accounts share a blind spot — they are the states
 * somebody thought of, and a greedy loop over a hundred candidates has more
 * states than anybody thinks of. A level exactly on a cap. A level one past a
 * threshold the cost table changes at. Everything maxed but one thing. Nothing
 * at all except the one upgrade that gates six others.
 *
 * So this generates them instead, and asserts only what must be true of *any*
 * account — the planner never throws, never returns a step it cannot price,
 * never goes backwards, and gives the same answer twice.
 *
 * ## Why the randomness is seeded
 *
 * A fuzz test that fails once and passes on re-run is worse than no test: it
 * teaches the reader to re-run rather than to look. The generator is a fixed
 * sequence, so a failure names an account that can be reproduced by index —
 * and the run is identical on every machine and every CI attempt.
