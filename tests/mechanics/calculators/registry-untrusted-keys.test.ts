/**
 * The same own-keys rule as `data/untrusted-key-lookups.test.ts`, applied to every
 * registered calculator at once.
 *
 * These are reachable by id from tools, from the MCP surface and from generated UI, with
 * arguments that ultimately come from saves and user input. A lookup inside any of them
 * that indexes a record without checking own-keys can return an `Object.prototype` member,
 * which is a function where the signature promises data — and `?? fallback` does not catch
 * a function.
 *
 * Throwing is a valid response to nonsense and is not reported, and neither is a factory
 * that returns a function by design — the test asks whether the returned value *is* one of
 * `Object.prototype`'s own members, not merely whether it is a function, so
 * `wiki.createCurlFetch` passes on its merits rather than by being named an exception.
