/**
 * The ultimate weapon vault has to REACH the ultimate weapons.
 *
 * `eDamage!CX6` is `(1 + $BL$39) * (1 + $BM$39)` — the ultimate weapon damage
 * relic times its vault — and the port reads it as one finished number. A
 * captured product is a constant, so for a long time buying a vault level
 * moved `spotlightDamage` and nothing else: the ultimate weapon half could not
 * respond to the one path that exists to buy vault levels.
 *
 * Nothing reported it, and nothing could have. The COMPOSITION was exactly
 * right — the constant carries the correct product, so every eDamage answer
 * matched the sheet to 1e-9 across 22 captured accounts. Only the CANDIDATE
 * was wrong. That is this repo's standing bug shape almost word for word:
 *
 *   supported by the model · never set by the wiring · nothing anywhere
 *   reports it
 *
 * Two independent claims are asserted here, both by MOVING an input and
 * watching the answer, never by restating the expression:
 *
 *   1. `config.ultimateWeaponDamageVaultPct` is READ. It was declared in the
 *      config, read from `BM39` by the sheet reader, and populated by the app
 *      from the player's vault tracker — and consumed by nothing whatsoever.
 *   2. `levels.keys.ultimateWeaponDamage` moves effective damage by more than
 *      Spotlight alone, which is what lets the keys planner rank the vault's
 *      Ultimate Weapon Damage node on its whole effect.
