/**
 * What is true of *any* path, whatever it is planning.
 *
 * ## Why structural checks and not values
 *
 * The value tests elsewhere compare a path against the sheet, one account at a
 * time. They are the authority on whether the numbers are right, and they say
 * nothing about whether the walk itself is sane.
 *
 * These do. A path is a sequence of purchases, and a sequence of purchases has
 * properties that hold regardless of the model behind it: you buy a level at a
 * time, you never buy past a cap, the running total only goes up, and asking
 * the same question twice gives the same answer. Each of those can break
 * without a single value being obviously wrong — a path that skips from level 4
 * to level 6 still shows plausible numbers in every row.
 *
 * They also cover every variant rather than the one an account happens to
 * exercise, which is what makes them cheap to keep.
