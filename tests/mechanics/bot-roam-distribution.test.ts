/**
 * Where bots actually go when they roam.
 *
 * `Bot.SetRandomDestination` is `Random.insideUnitCircle * (RADIUS_PERCENTAGE * sqrt(
 * Main.maxDistance))`, and `insideUnitCircle` is uniform over the circle's AREA. Scaling a
 * plain `value()` by the radius instead is uniform along the RADIUS, which is a different
 * distribution entirely: its density falls off as 1/r, so points pile up near the tower.
 *
 * Both look like "a random point in a circle" and both produce plausible pictures, which is
 * why the wrong one survived. The distinction shows up as a mean distance of R/2 instead of
 * 2R/3, and it decides how much two bots overlap BY ACCIDENT — bunched at the tower they sit
 * on top of each other most of the time, so a small Bot Bot circle already catches most of a
 * large bot's area and matching their ranges looks close to worthless.
 *
 * Asserted as a distribution rather than a sequence, because that is what the claim is. A
 * fixed-seed snapshot would pass just as happily with the wrong sampler.
