/**
 * The point of these tests is to fail if the formula reverts to the linear
 * reading the oracle carried until 2026-08-18. Each planted fault below was run
 * against the suite before being written down, and each one turns a test red:
 *
 *  - `base * combo - 1` instead of `pow(base, combo) - 1` → the divergence and
 *    round-trip tests fail (the low-combo cases still pass, which is the whole
 *    reason the wrong reading survived).
 *  - dropping the `- 1` → the combo-zero test fails.
 *  - dropping `Math.fround` → the float32 test fails.
