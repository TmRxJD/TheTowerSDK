/**
 * Every candidate a plan leaves out is accounted for.
 *
 * ## Why this is not cosmetic
 *
 * The greedy loop passes over a candidate for three reasons — it is at its cap,
 * it has no usable price, or the model cannot value it — and all three used to
 * be a bare `continue`. A candidate dropped that way appeared in neither the
 * steps nor the exclusions, so a path that stopped early or ranked something
 * strange had no explanation anywhere.
 *
 * That cost real time. A live account planned a module level nine orders of
 * magnitude worse per day than a lab whose next level simply never appeared,
 * and it read as a ranking bug for a whole round of investigation. It was not:
 * every lab on the account was already at its cap. The plan now says so.
 *
 * So the rule is: **a candidate is planned, or it is explained.** Never
 * neither.
