/**
 * Which of the sheet's controls does the port actually read?
 *
 * ## What was already proven, and what was not
 *
 * The parity fixtures compare the port against the live spreadsheet across
 * randomised accounts with every toggle varied — ten states for eDamage, twelve
 * for eEcon, forty for eHP, plus a single-point shadow per candidate that
 * proves the ORDERING and not merely the starting number. That answers "are the
 * numbers right for these states".
 *
 * It cannot answer two things, and both are this repo's signature defect:
 *
 * 1. **Is an exposed input wired?** A control both the sheet and the port
 *    ignore agrees perfectly. Flipping it and requiring the answer to move is
 *    the only check that separates "modelled" from "read".
 * 2. **Is an input exposed at all?** A control the port never accepts cannot
 *    disagree with the sheet — it simply is not offered, and a parity suite
 *    stays green while the planner answers for one configuration.
 *
 * The second is the larger finding here and it is a SCOPE statement, not a bug:
 * `EffectiveDamageConfig` covers the stat controls and none of the path
 * controls. Those are enumerated below from `ep-graph`, so the list cannot
 * quietly go stale as either side changes.
