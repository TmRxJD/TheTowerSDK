/**
 * Tournament heat has to reach the thorns model at every wave, not just at the breakpoints.
 *
 * The heat table lists 19 waves. It is an INTERVAL table: the row for wave 400 governs 400 to 449,
 * which is how `getHeatEffectivenessPercent` reads it. The thorns calculator kept a private copy
 * and read it with `find(entry => entry.wave === wave)` -- an exact match, so it produced a value
 * at nineteen waves out of a thousand and `undefined` at every other one.
 *
 * `undefined` is the signal for "not in a tournament", so those waves silently fell back to the
 * flat campaign-tier effectiveness. Nothing errored, nothing logged, and the numbers stayed
 * plausible; the tournament setting simply did nothing for 98% of the waves a player can enter.
 *
 * These assertions are written so they cannot pass on the shape of the implementation:
 * the first compares two waves INSIDE one interval, and the second compares against the
 * canonical helper rather than against a number copied out of the same table.
