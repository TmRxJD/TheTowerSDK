/**
 * Order of operations, checked against the function the game runs.
 *
 * The calculation is branch-free arithmetic (v28.3.0), so the order the terms
 * combine in IS the specification:
 *
 *   sum sources -> x enhancement -> clamp 0..1
 *     -> subtract ELS Reduction -> clamp 0
 *     -> multiply by Skip Reduction - Multiply
 *     -> subtract Skip Decay -> clamp 0
 *
 * Every step is commutative-looking and none of them are. Swapping any pair
 * still returns a number in range, which is why this needs pinning rather than
 * reviewing.
