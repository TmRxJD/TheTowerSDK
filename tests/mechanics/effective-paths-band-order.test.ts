/**
 * Declaration order IS the tie-break, so it has to match the sheet's columns.
 *
 * `EPP_MATRIX` picks the winner as
 *
 *     maxROI,      MAX(FILTER(line_roi, line_roi<>""))
 *     firstMaxCol, MIN(FILTER(COLUMN(line_roi), line_roi=maxROI))
 *
 * -- the LEFTMOST column of the joint maximum. The port's planner takes the
 * first candidate with a strictly greater ROI, which is the same rule only if
 * it walks the candidates in the sheet's column order. Nothing in the planner
 * enforces that; it is a property of how `EFFECTIVE_DAMAGE_UPGRADES` happens to
 * be written, and adding an upgrade in the wrong place would change which of
 * two tied candidates is bought without changing any value.
 *
 * That is the defect shape this repo keeps finding -- correct in the model,
 * never checked in the wiring, and invisible because the numbers are right.
 * A tie is rare, which makes it worse: it would not show up in a sweep for a
 * long time, and then only as one account picking a different upgrade.
 *
 * Headers below are the sheet's own, read from the ROI band of each satellite
 * tab in the 2026-08-20 whole-workbook dump.
