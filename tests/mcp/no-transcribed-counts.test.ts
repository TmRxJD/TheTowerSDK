/**
 * A tool must not carry a count it cannot keep current.
 *
 * `sheet_info` warned "23 of the 30 tabs are HIDDEN. The tab list marks none of them." Both numbers
 * were wrong. Against the canonical spreadsheet it is 24 of 30; against the working copy the oracle
 * actually points at, 24 of 33.
 *
 * The number was not merely stale — it was impossible. `SHEET_ID` is `process.env.EPATHS_SHEET_ID
 * || CANONICAL_SHEET_ID`, so the tool describes whichever spreadsheet the environment names, and no
 * single transcribed count can be right for all of them.
 *
 * And the data was already in hand: `properties.hidden` comes back in the same
 * `spreadsheets.get` response the tool was already making, and was being dropped on the floor while
 * prose beside it guessed at what it said. Supported by the model, never set by the wiring, nothing
 * reports it — the shape this codebase produces more than any other.
 *
 * The live numbers cannot be asserted here (that needs the service account), so this holds the
 * durable half: the response derives its counts, and the prose does not restate them.
