/**
 * Every lab the game has must survive the join into something the UI can render.
 *
 * The failure this exists for is not a crash and not a wrong number — it is a lab that
 * simply is not there. `LAB_RESEARCH_BY_INDEX` is generated from the game and holds every
 * lab; `LAB_CATALOG` is hand-owned and holds fewer. Category is enriched from the second,
 * and `SITE_LAB_TYPE_BY_SLUG` skips anything with no category (`if (!lab.category) continue`).
 * A lab missing from the hand-owned list therefore comes back category-less, and the labs
 * page renders by category — so it has no bucket and never appears.
 *
 * That is how four module labs (Cannon / Armor / Generator / Core Stats) sat in shipped
 * data, resolvable by index, and invisible on the page for at least a release. Nothing
 * reported it, because nothing compared the two lists.
 *
 * This calls the real `findLabResearchByIndex` rather than re-deriving the join. Two
 * previous attempts to find the gap by matching on display name and then on slug both gave
 * wrong answers — the two sides disagree on both (`Berzerker` vs `Berserker`,
 * `golden_bot_cooldown` vs the catalog's own slug), and an alias layer sits between them.
 * Re-implementing a join to test a join measures the re-implementation.

 *
 * Bastion is NOT listed. It was pulled from the final v29 build during testing and is
 * expected back reworked, but it needs no exclusion: `Bastion Mastery` (249) is absent from
 * the shipped research data entirely, and `Recharge Bastion` (250) has been in the hand
 * catalog with a category all along. Listing either would have been a note about the game
 * masquerading as a note about this data — and asserting one of them was uncategorised is
 * exactly the kind of unchecked claim the second test caught.
