/**
 * `benefitType` on a module effect row is the game's `BenefitType` enum, and **v29 re-based
 * that enum**. It was not appended to — it was redesigned:
 *
 *   v28.3  Normal=0 Add=1 Add10=2 AddMult=3 Multiply=4 Percentage=5 Percentage100=6
 *          Subtract=7 Time=8 AddTime=9 SubtractTime=10 Meters=11 Angle=12   (13 members)
 *
 *   v29    None=0 Percentage1=10 Percentage100=20 Seconds=30 Time=40
 *          Meters=50 Angle=60                                               (7 members)
 *
 * Nine v28.3 members were removed, and the survivors moved (Percentage100 6 -> 20,
 * Time 8 -> 40, Meters 11 -> 50, Angle 12 -> 60). The new spacing is deliberate, leaving
 * room between members.
 *
 * The shipped table is still v28.3-coded, and nothing in the SDK or the app branches on
 * these values today — they are carried through `getModuleEffectRow()` and the module save
 * decoder and never interpreted. That is exactly why this needs a test rather than a fix:
 * the day someone regenerates the asset tables from a v29 dump, every one of these numbers
 * silently changes meaning, and no existing assertion would notice. A `6` would keep
 * reading as "Percentage100" to a human while the game now calls that `Percentage1`.
 *
 * When the table IS regenerated from v29: update the expected set below to the v29 space,
 * and check every consumer of `benefitType` at that moment — `data/modules/effect-resolver`,
 * `save/modules/decode`, and the v28.3 parity test.
