/**
 * The relic catalog against the game's own import catalog.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to end
 *
 * `RELIC_TEMPLATES` is hand-maintained plus generated, and the generator used a
 * hand-authored `benefitType -> stat` table with nine values missing and a
 * `?? 'Damage'` fallback underneath. Anything the table did not cover became a
 * Damage relic, silently. Eight relics were wrong that way, among them every
 * **Free Attack Upgrade** one, because 18 was in neither the table nor the
 * description parser.
 *
 * Nothing caught it. It surfaced only as an Effective Paths economy residual —
 * the community sheet summing 0.12 of free-attack-upgrade relic where we summed
 * 0.08 — and the first conclusion drawn was that the sheet was over-counting.
 * It was not; the three relics making up the difference were in our catalog
 * under the wrong stat.
 *
 * ## Why the enum is re-derived rather than asserted
 *
 * `RELIC_IMPORT_CATALOG` carries both a numeric `benefitType` and a prose
 * `description` for each relic, so the mapping between them is a fact about the
 * data rather than a constant to be trusted. This rebuilds it and fails if any
 * `benefitType` ever resolves to two different descriptions — which would mean
 * the enum had shifted under us, and every bonus type in the catalog with it.
