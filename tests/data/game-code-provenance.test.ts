/**
 * Every number this package ships about the game must match what the game's own code says.
 *
 * The catalogs here were assembled from the wiki, from community sheets and from earlier
 * extractions, and a wrong value in one of them does not fail — it renders, and it feeds a
 * planner. Two were wrong before this file existed:
 *
 *   - Wave Accelerator level 5 said 48% where the game shows 46%, breaking the card's own
 *     +4 progression (30 / 34 / 38 / 42 / 46 / 50 / 54)
 *   - Milestone tier 1 wave 10 said 10 Coins where the game shows 25
 *
 * WHAT THE STORED TABLE IS NOT. `cardBenefit` is the value the game keeps, and for most
 * cards it is also the value the game SHOWS. For some it is not, and the card screen is the
 * authority on what a player sees. Two are known and listed in `STORED_DIFFERS_FROM_SHOWN`
 * below; both were "corrected" here against the stored table before screenshots settled it,
 * which is the mistake this comment exists to stop repeating. A difference between the two
 * is a fact about the game worth recording, not a defect in this package to be patched away.
 *
 * The comparison is against `facts/<version>/*.json`, which are written by tower-extractor
 * from the shipped binary. Those files carry game data only — identifiers, values, units —
 * because how they were obtained is evidence for that repo to keep, not something a consumer
 * of this package should have to read past.
 *
 * UNITS are the one subtlety, and they are handled explicitly rather than by loosening the
 * comparison. The game stores a fraction where this package stores a percent, a multiplier
 * where it stores a percent increase, and seconds where it stores minutes. Each card is
 * checked under the conventions its own `levelType` allows, so a real difference cannot hide
 * behind a unit and a unit is never reported as a difference.
