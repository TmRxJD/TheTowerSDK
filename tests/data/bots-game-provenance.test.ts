/**
 * The bot tables, checked against the game's own numbers.
 *
 * `facts/<version>/bots.json` is written from the shipped binary: the stat curves come out
 * of `Bots.Initialize`, the grouping out of `GetBotStatIndices`, and the cost ladders out of
 * `GetBotLevelUpCost` and `GetBotPlusUpgradeCostAtLevel` — run, not read.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS GUARDING. The twenty stat slots are not laid out four-per-bot, and the four
 * columns are NOT the same four stats for every bot:
 *
 *     Flame    Damage    Range  Cooldown  Damage Reduction
 *     Thunder  Duration  Range  Cooldown  Linger
 *     Golden   Bonus     Range  Cooldown  Duration
 *     Amplify  Bonus     Range  Cooldown  Duration
 *     Bot      Bonus     Range  Cooldown  Duration
 *
 * Only Range and Cooldown are common to all five. Flame has neither a Duration nor a Bonus.
 * Anything that reads the columns positionally — and a per-bot allocator is exactly the kind
 * of thing that wants to — gets Flame and Thunder wrong while every number it reads stays
 * individually plausible. So this asserts the stat NAMES per bot, not just the values.
 *
 * Amplify's Bot+ ladder steps 200 a level where every other bot steps 50. That is a real
 * difference and it is easy to lose to a shared constant, so it is checked by name.
