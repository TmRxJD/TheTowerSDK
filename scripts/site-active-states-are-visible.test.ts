/**
 * An active state has to be visible, not merely applied.
 *
 * `layout.css` sets `a { color: var(--color-accent) }`. A bare element selector in a global
 * stylesheet outranks a single utility class, so the docs contents list rendered
 * `text-accent` and `text-muted` as the same colour: every entry looked identical, and the
 * highlight for the section being read was invisible.
 *
 * The code was correct throughout. Two browser checks asserted that the class was on the right
 * element and passed while nothing on screen changed — which is the difference between testing
 * what the code does and testing what a reader sees, and is why this file exists.
 *
 * It reads the stylesheet rather than a browser, so it cannot prove a colour reaches the screen.
 * What it can prove is that the rule which lost is not the one being relied on again.
