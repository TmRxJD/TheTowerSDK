/**
 * The map has to be true, and it has to be cheap to keep true.
 *
 * A generated map is worth exactly as much as its worst entry. One stale row — a file that moved, a
 * dependency that reversed, an export that was renamed — and a reader stops trusting the whole
 * table and goes back to grepping, which is the state the map exists to replace.
 *
 * `lint:map` is in `verify`, so drift fails the build. What is left for a test is the part `--check`
 * cannot see about itself: that the generator does not destroy what it walks past, that it agrees
 * with itself when run twice, and that its own guard fires.
 *
 * Three near-misses are the reason each case is here, all three found by running the generator a
 * second time rather than by reading it:
 *
 * - CRLF. Matching the end of a docblock as `\n` failed on every CRLF file, so the block landed
 *   ABOVE the prose, hid it from the next run, and every Purpose column emptied on generation two.
 * - TSDoc. A docblock on the first export looks exactly like a file docblock from the top of the
 *   file. Inserting between them detaches the comment from its symbol: editor hovers and API docs
 *   lose it, and nothing anywhere reports that they did.
 * - `src/MAP.md` written twice, once as the directory map and once as the index, leaving `--check`
 *   permanently red against a file it had just written itself.
