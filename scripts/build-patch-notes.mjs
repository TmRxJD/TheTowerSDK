/**
 * Turn the raw patch-notes archive into the dataset that ships.
 *
 * The raw archive is Discord JSON with message and author ids; this is the part worth shipping —
 * what changed, in which version, on what date, in the developers' own words.
 *
 * ## The date is not the message timestamp
 *
 * Most notes were FORWARDED into the channel, and 176 of them on the same afternoon. Their
 * `timestamp` is when someone forwarded them; the snapshot carries when they were actually
 * posted, which for the oldest is 2021. Dating by message timestamp would put four years of
 * history on one day in 2025 and answer every "when did this change" with the same wrong answer.
 *
 * ## Parsing is conservative and reports what it could not do
 *
 * A version is taken only from a recognisable form near the start of the note. Anything without
 * one keeps its date and text and is marked `version: null` rather than being guessed at — a
 * wrong version attached to a real change is worse than no version, because it reads as fact.

 * Pull the version out of a note, or return null.

 * Two ways this went wrong before, both producing a confident wrong number:
 *
 *   - `\bv?(\d+\.\d+…)` is CASE-SENSITIVE. In "V26.1.2" the `v?` did not match the capital V,
 *     and since `V` and `2` are both word characters there is no boundary between them — so the
 *     match started mid-number and returned `1.2`. Three notes were filed under a version that
 *     has never existed.
 *   - a bare number matches a multiplier as readily as a version: "x1.05" in the opening of a
 *     note about a new card filed it under v1.05.
 *
 * So a `v` prefix wins outright, and a bare number is taken only from a heading and only when
 * nothing marks it as a multiplier. Anything else stays null, which is a real answer.
