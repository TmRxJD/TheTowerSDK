/**
 * Checks on the checks.
 *
 * Every guard in this package was written because something went wrong once, and each one is only
 * worth its lines while it actually runs over the thing it describes. Three failed that in one
 * session, all silently:
 *
 * - `audit-package-contents` asserts the tarball's real contents and was named in the publish
 *   documentation. No script and no workflow ran it. It found two test files shipping the moment
 *   it was wired in.
 * - The extraction scrubber walked `.ts` and `.mjs`, so a JSON file kept three citations naming a
 *   symbol and an address, and the guard that runs it in `--check` mode passed throughout — it
 *   never opened the file.
 * - Vitest's `include` stopped at `src` and `scripts`, so tests written next to the MCP server
 *   were collected by nothing.
 *
 * A guard that cannot run, or cannot see, is indistinguishable from a guard with nothing to
 * report. These tests are the ones that notice.
