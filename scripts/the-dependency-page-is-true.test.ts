/**
 * What the site says about dependencies must be what the manifest says.
 *
 * A dependency page is exactly the kind that rots without breaking. Add a second runtime
 * dependency and the page keeps rendering "one runtime dependency" — correct prose about a package
 * that no longer exists. And the claim is not decorative: it tells a reader what enters their tree
 * and whose license travels with what they ship.
 *
 * The README and `docs/DESKTOP_AND_MOBILE.md` both said "no runtime dependencies" while the
 * package depended on zod, which is how this was found. Nothing was wrong with the sentence when
 * it was written; the dependency arrived later and nothing connected the two.
 *
 * So this reads `package.json` and holds the pages to it, rather than restating a number.
