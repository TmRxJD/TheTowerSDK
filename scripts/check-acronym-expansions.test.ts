/**
 * A check nobody can make fail tests nothing.
 *
 * The value of this one is entirely in its precision: an initials sweep over ~300 acronyms
 * collides with almost every Title-Case phrase in English, and the first version reported 1,399
 * findings, of which zero were real. So these tests plant the two failure shapes and then assert
 * the specific false-positive classes that were fixed on the way down to zero — because each of
 * those was a bug in the check, and a check that regains them is a check nobody will read.
