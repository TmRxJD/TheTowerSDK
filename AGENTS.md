# Working in this repo (for AI agents)

This file is the canonical instruction set. `CLAUDE.md` and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` point here rather than duplicating it — edit this one.

## What this package is

`thetowersdk` gives you the game's data and a reader for a player's save file, so you can build
calculators and tools for **The Tower** (TechTree Games' idle tower defence game). It is pure
TypeScript: no framework, no I/O outside the save decoder, no global state.

Everything here is about that one game. Nothing in this package is generic infrastructure.

## Two rules, before anything else

1. **Look up the mechanic before you describe it.** This package gives values, not meaning. See
   [Consult the wiki](#consult-the-wiki-before-describing-a-mechanic) and the monorepo contract
   [`docs/AGENT_GAME_MECHANICS_CONTRACT.md`](../../docs/AGENT_GAME_MECHANICS_CONTRACT.md) —
   `begin_mechanic_task` is mandatory when MCP is available. It is not optional.
2. **Find the export; do not invent one.** There are 2,007 exports across six entry points. Use the
   map below, then `list_exports` with a filter, then `get_export`. A plausible-looking name you
   guessed will not exist.

**Never claim a mechanic change is finished** until the human tested and approved. Ledger statuses:
`researching` | `implementing` | `awaiting_user` | `user_approved` | `blocked` — never `done`.
Monorepo commits: [`docs/AGENT_COMMIT_SCHEMA.md`](../../docs/AGENT_COMMIT_SCHEMA.md) (`status/checkpoint` default).
Living map: [`docs/mechanics-map/MAP.md`](../../docs/mechanics-map/MAP.md).

## Where things are

Sizes are exports, not files — they say how much you are searching through.

| Entry point | Exports | Holds | Reach for it when |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `thetowersdk/data` | 374 | Game tables and catalogs | You need a cost, a level curve, an effect value, a name |
| `thetowersdk/save` | 436 | `playerInfo.dat` readers | You need what a specific player has |
| `thetowersdk/mechanics` | 1132 | Formulas | You need to compute something the game computes |
| `thetowersdk/formatting` | 33 | Number and duration display | You need it to read the way the game shows it |
| `thetowersdk/node` | 8 | The save decoder | You have bytes and need a save root (Node only) |
| `thetowersdk/wiki` | 24 | Wikitext → Markdown, page fetch | You need to know how a mechanic behaves |

`thetowersdk/internal/*` is **not** public: no stability guarantee, and it will move. Needing it is a
gap worth reporting, not a path to depend on.

### `data` — the game's tables

Catalogs are the entry into game data. Each is an array of typed rows.

| Catalog | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `LAB_CATALOG` | Every research lab: levels, coin cost and duration per level, caps |
| `CARD_IMPORT_CATALOG` | Cards, their ids, rarities and per-level values |
| `MODULE_TEMPLATES` · `MODULE_SUBSTAT_CANONICAL_DATA` | Modules, rarities, substat definitions |
| `ULTIMATE_WEAPON_IMPORT_CATALOG` | The nine weapons, their stats and plus-levels |
| `BOT_IMPORT_CATALOG` · `GUARDIAN_CHIP_IMPORT_CATALOG` | Bots and guardian chips |
| `VAULT_POWER_IMPORT_CATALOG` · `VAULT_HARMONY_IMPORT_CATALOG` | The two vault trees |
| `RELIC_IMPORT_CATALOG` | Relics and their bonus types — **read the note on units below** |
| `LAB_RESEARCH_IMPORT_CATALOG` | Research entries as the save stores them |
| `PLAYER_DATA_FIELD_CATALOG` | Named save fields |
| `CURRENCY_DEFINITIONS` · `TOWER_MODULE_TYPE_ENUM` · `RESEARCH_CATEGORY_ENUM` | Enumerations |
| `getWorkshopStatDefinitions()` | Workshop stats — a function, because it builds from tables |
| `sharedToolsCatalog` | The Run Tracker's own tool list (links, categories) |
| `GLOSSARY` · `lookupGlossary` · `expandAcronym` | What a term or acronym means |

**A cost is a plain number of coins.** `1.1e15` is 1.1 quadrillion. There is no scaling factor to
apply and no currency field to read first, so two labs can be added together directly.

**Units are not uniform across a catalog.** A relic bonus may be a percentage, metres, seconds or a
multiplier, and the unit lives in the game's description text rather than beside the number. Check
before you format one.

### `save` — what a player has

32 `read*FromSaveRoot` extractors. The important ones:

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `readLabsFromSaveRoot` | Research levels, what is maxed, the active queue |
| `readWorkshopFromSaveRoot` | Upgrade levels, enhancements, saved presets |
| `readModulesFromSaveRoot` | Owned modules, rarities, substats, what is equipped |
| `readCardsFromSaveRoot` | Card levels, copies, mastery, equipped slots |
| `readUltimateWeaponsFromSaveRoot` | Weapon levels, unlocks, plus-levels, stones |
| `readVaultFromSaveRoot` · `readRelicsFromSaveRoot` · `readBotsFromSaveRoot` · `readGuardiansFromSaveRoot` | The rest of the account |
| `readLifetimeFromSaveRoot` · `readDissonanceFromSaveRoot` | Totals and echo progress |
| `listImportableBattleRuns` | Run history, with every stored field |
| `discoverSaveImportTrackers` | "What is even in this save?" — counts and summaries |

Rules that hold for all of them:

- **They return `null` rather than throwing** when a save predates a feature. Always check.
- **Read `warnings`** — what they could not interpret, rather than dropping it silently.
- **Never mutate `parsedRoot`.** Callers run many extractors over the same object.
- **Arrays are positional and over-allocated.** `relicsUnlocked[112]` is relic 112; unused slots are
  not always zero, and the card level array pads with `1`. Use the unlock flag where one exists.
- **A save can be older than the catalog.** 305 relics in the catalog and 236 in the save means the
  rest are *absent*, not locked. Do not present them as things the player is missing.

### `mechanics` — the formulas

1,132 exports. By area, so you know which filter to pass `list_exports`:

| Area | ~Exports | Covers |
|---|---:|---|
| Enemies | 276 | Wave/tier base health and damage, type multipliers, level skip, elite spawns, wave-info panel |
| Damage | 147 | Crit, multishot, bounce, rend armor, thorns, shockwave, land mines, knockback, tower fire and range |
| Ultimates | 92 | The shared hit/absorb pipeline, Chrono Field, Poison Swamp, Inner Land Mines, Golden Tower, Black Hole, Death Wave, Spotlight |
| Economy | 91 | Coin and drop simulation, interest, ROI scaling, cost tables |
| Workshop | 58 | Attack, defence and utility stat curves |
| Effective Paths | 54 | The upgrade-order solver — see below |
| Bots and guardians | 51 | Hit multipliers, range and coverage, medal planning, cooldowns |
| Labs | 34 | Research durations, costs, speed modifiers |
| Modules · Cards | 33 | Module stat computation, card effect lookup |
| Battle conditions | 22 | Resistance levels, tournament heat, counter labs |

`MECHANICS_COVERAGE` states how much of the game each area reproduces: `confirmed` means checked
against the game's implementation, `partial` means correct within limits named in its `gaps`.

### Effective Paths — the upgrade-order solver

Ports the community [Effective Paths][ep-agents] spreadsheet: given an account, what to buy next for
the most effect per unit of cost.

| Model | Planner | Variants |
|---|---|---|
| eHP | `planEffectiveHealthPath` | `lab-time` · `lab-coins` · `stone` · `coin` |
| eRegen | `planEffectiveRegenPath` | `lab-time` · `lab-coins` |
| eDamage | `planEffectiveDamagePath` | `lab-time` · `lab-coins` · `stone` · `coin` · `keys` |
| eEcon | `planEffectiveEconomyPath` | `time` · `coin` · `stone` |
| eEcon Discount | `planEffectiveEconomyDiscountPath` | ranks coins **saved**, not earned |

Every planner takes `{ config, levels, variant, steps }` and returns `{ steps, excluded, issues }`.

- **config** = the account: what is unlocked, owned, equipped. Start from `zeroEffective*Config()`.
- **levels** = how far each candidate is bought. Start from `ZERO_EFFECTIVE_*_LEVELS` and fill it —
  a missing key is `undefined`, which becomes a `NaN` the planner refuses.
- **`excluded`** = candidates not offered, each with a reason. A candidate is planned or it is
  explained, never neither. A short path usually means everything else is at its cap.
- **`issues`** = why nothing could be planned. Empty on every plan that ran.

`EFFECTIVE_*_UPGRADES` lists the candidates with the `id`, `band`, `key` and `sheetName` you map your
own data onto. The README has a worked example.

## Consult the wiki before describing a mechanic

This package supplies the game's data and formulas. It does not document game behaviour: a table
gives a value, not what that value means, when it applies, or what it interacts with. Confirm
behaviour against the community wiki before describing it in code, comments or output.

**Forced MCP workflow** (same for Cursor, Claude, Copilot):

```
begin_mechanic_task { mechanic, intent, relatedHints? }
wiki_page   { title }     # every related title from the task — not one
define_term { term }
record_mechanic_note { token, mechanic, facts, sources, relatesTo? }
record_work_status   { token, title, status, summary }
```

Also:

```
wiki_search { query: "wave skip" }
wiki_page   { title: "Wave Skip" }
wiki_page   { title: "Cards", section: "Costs" }
```

In code, `fetchFandomPageAsMarkdown` from `thetowersdk/wiki` does the same. Without MCP, the wiki is
at `the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com`.

Behaviour that is not derivable from the data alone includes ability sources (one weapon's damage
scaling from another's stat), unlock thresholds spanning several entities, and units — a relic
bonus may be metres or seconds where a neighbouring one is a percentage, and the unit appears only
in the game's description text.

**Offline use.** Set `TOWER_WIKI_DIR` to a directory of `slug.md` pages; both tools read it before
the network. Every response reports `source: "local" | "cache" | "fandom"`, so a stale local page is
distinguishable from a fresh fetch.

**Living map.** Set `TOWER_MECHANICS_MAP_DIR` to override where `record_mechanic_note` writes
(default: monorepo `docs/mechanics-map`).

### Wiki content and licensing

The wiki declares **CC-BY-SA**; this package is MIT, so wiki text is fetched rather than bundled.

CC-BY-SA permits redistribution and adaptation — converting wikitext to Markdown is an adaptation —
provided the result carries the same licence, credits the source, and records that it was changed.
Content may therefore be distributed as a separate package declaring
`license: "CC-BY-SA-3.0"` with an attribution notice. `TOWER_WIKI_DIR` is the integration point for
such a package.

## The entry points, and which to use

| Import | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `thetowersdk/data` | Game tables — costs, levels, effects, catalogs, reference tables |
| `thetowersdk/save` | Reading a player's `playerInfo.dat` into typed values |
| `thetowersdk/node` | Decoding the save file (needs Node; browsers see the recipe in the README) |
| `thetowersdk/formatting` | Numbers and durations formatted the way the game shows them |
| `thetowersdk/mechanics` | Formulas — enemy scaling, damage, drops, workshop stats |
| `thetowersdk/wiki` | Fandom wikitext → Markdown, and fetching a page |

Import from the subpath, not the root barrel, unless you genuinely want everything.

**`thetowersdk/internal/*` is not the public API.** It has no stability guarantee and will move.
If you find yourself reaching into it, that is a gap worth reporting rather than a path to depend on.

## Rules that will save you a bad afternoon

**Extractors return `null`, they do not throw.** A save written before a feature existed has no data
for it. Always check:

```ts
const labs = readLabsFromSaveRoot(parsedRoot)
if (!labs) return
```

**Read `warnings`.** Extractors report what they could not interpret rather than dropping it
silently. A populated `warnings` usually means the save shape changed.

**Save arrays are positional and over-allocated.** `relicsUnlocked[112]` is relic 112. Arrays are
often longer than the number of real entities, and unused slots are not always zero — the card level
array pads with `1`, not `0`. Use the unlock flag when one exists, not the level.

**A save can be older than the catalog.** If the catalog has 305 relics and the save array has 236,
the rest are *absent*, not locked. Do not present them as things the player is missing.

**Never mutate `parsedRoot`.** Callers run many extractors over the same object.

**Do not invent a name.** The game's names, and the community shorthand for them, are in the
glossary: `lookupGlossary('SR')`, `expandAcronym('ILM')`. Several acronyms are ambiguous, and a
confident wrong expansion is worse than none. If a term is not in the glossary, look it up in the
catalogs rather than guessing — the MCP server's `define_term` does both.

**Formulas under `mechanics/` are approximations.** They are fitted to observed behaviour and drift
at very high waves and tiers. Do not use them where an exact match to the game matters.

**`effective-paths-*` is a transcription, and the sheet is the authority.** Not these files'
comments, not the wiki, not the game dump — the spreadsheet. Every rule cites the cell it came from
(`eEcon!E6`, `eDamage Coins!EZ2`) and `effective-paths-cell-references.test.ts` enumerates those
citations and pins how many there are. When it fails because you added one, **read the cell before
updating the count**; that failure is the prompt, not paperwork.

Before deriving a number in this area, read
[`EFFECTIVE_PATHS_ORACLE.md`](../../docs/EFFECTIVE_PATHS_ORACLE.md) in the tracker repo. It lists the
ways the spreadsheet API misleads — chiefly that a spilled range reads as *empty* through both
`read_range` and `FORMULA` render while `COUNTA` sees a hundred rows of it. That has twice been
mistaken for a missing feature.

**A planner explains everything it leaves out.** `plan.excluded` carries a reason per candidate, and
`planPath`'s `onSkip` reports the three ways the loop passes one over. Keep it that way: a path that
stops after one step usually means every other candidate is at its cap, and without a reason that is
indistinguishable from a bug. The rule is **planned, or explained — never neither.**

**A path variant is refused, not guessed at.** `lab` is a damage *band* and `lab-time` is a
*variant*. Passing the band matched no band's variant list, skipped every candidate, and returned an
empty path that looked exactly like a finished account. All four planners now throw and name what
they publish. Do not soften that into a default.

## Conventions this package enforces

`pnpm lint:conventions` checks these; it runs in CI and will fail a PR.

- **File names** are kebab-case and say what the file is. Inside `data/` and `save/` the directory
  already gives the context, so the file is named for the thing: `save/labs.ts`, not
  `save/labs-from-save.ts`.
- **Everything public is exported from its barrel** (`src/<area>/index.ts`). A module that is not
  exported cannot be imported by anyone, which is almost never what you meant.
- **No default exports.** Named exports only, so tooling and re-exports stay predictable.
- **Extractors are `extract<Thing>FromSaveRoot(root)`** and return `T | null`.
- **Data tables are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` `readonly` arrays or records.** Same shape every time —
  no one-off exports that behave differently from their neighbours.
- **No imports from a barrel inside the same area.** Import the sibling module directly; importing
  your own `index.ts` creates a cycle.
- **The package never imports itself by name.** Inside `src/`, use relative paths — `thetowersdk/...`
  only resolves when a build happens to exist and breaks as soon as `clean` runs.

## Checking things without writing a script

There is an MCP server in [`mcp/`](mcp/README.md). Point your agent at it and you can list exports,
read a table, define a term, decode a save, run an extractor, and plan an Effective Path directly —
useful for confirming a value instead of assuming one.

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm mcp
```

`plan_effective_path` is the quickest way to see which candidates a path offers and why the rest are
out, without writing a scratch script. It plans from a zero config, so read it for structure rather
than for numbers.

`wiki_search` and `wiki_page` are the ones to reach for **first** when the question is "how does X
work" rather than "what value does X have". See the top of this file.

## Verifying a value

**Use a source's own accessor rather than a positional offset.** When checking data against an
external source, address it the way the source does. An index computed by counting rows is a second
thing that can be wrong, and it fails silently by appearing to disagree with correct data.

**Check the fixture before the code.** A failing test more often means an unrepresentative fixture —
invented identifiers, an inverted nested structure, a stub returning a different shape than the real
collaborator — than a defect in what it tests.

**Assert against the source, not against the implementation.** A test that recomputes the expression
it is checking passes regardless of whether the expression is right. Call the exported function and
compare with a value read from the source it models.

**Prove a guard by introducing the fault it catches.** A guard that cannot be made to fail has not
been shown to work. Confirm the edit that introduces the fault actually applied.

**Constrain values to what the source allows, not to what seems reasonable.** Validation tighter than
the source rejects legitimate data. Where a check rejects input by returning an empty result, that
outcome is indistinguishable from "nothing to do" unless the reason is reported alongside it.

**Reproduce a calculation from its inputs.** Working backwards from a rendered number introduces
formatting and rounding as unknowns.

**Rule out a stale artefact before reading source.** Empty or unchanged output is frequently a cached
bundle, a module-graph cache, or the wrong host. Reload without cache and check the served file's
timestamp first.

## Before you open a PR

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm verify      # lint + conventions + types + build + tests
```

Individually: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm lint:conventions`, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`,
`pnpm test:schema`, `pnpm build`.

## Adding things

**A new extractor** — put it in `src/save/`, export it from `src/save/index.ts`, return `null` when
the data is absent, and add a test. Index-mapping bugs are silent: they misreport a player's data
rather than failing, so a test with a real shape is worth more than it looks.

**A new data table** — put it in `src/data/`, export it from `src/data/index.ts`, and declare its
schema in `src/data/schemas.ts` so `pnpm test:schema` validates it. If it introduces names, rerun
`node scripts/generate-glossary.mjs` so the glossary covers them.

**A new formula** — put it in `src/mechanics/`, export it from `src/mechanics/index.ts`, and say in
the doc comment whether it is exact or fitted.

**A test for any of it** — three rules, each of which has already caught a real fault here and each
of which was learned by shipping the opposite:

1. *Do not restate the implementation.* A test that computed `cost / (rate * 23)` and compared it
   against `cost / (rate * 23)` stayed green when the constant became `24`. Call the export.
2. *Pin several states, not one.* A constant agrees with a formula at exactly one input — four
   frozen rates here each matched at a different single point and were wrong everywhere else.
3. *Prove it by breaking what it guards.* Change the value the test exists to pin and watch it fail
   by name. If it does not, it is testing itself.

## What not to do

- Do not add a runtime dependency without a strong reason. There is exactly one (`zod`), and that
  keeps the package usable everywhere.
- Do not put site-specific concerns here — persistence, UI, cloud sync, analytics. This package
  models the game, not any one application.
- Do not describe where the data came from. Document what a value *is* and what breaks if it
  changes, not its provenance.
