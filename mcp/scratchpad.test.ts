 * The scratchpad had never been run.

 * installed the package it was advertised in `tools/list` and failed to spawn on every call.
 * Nothing reported that, because nothing had ever called it. `src/mcp-server.test.ts` covers the
 * handshake and the wiki tools, and vitest's include stopped at `src` and `scripts`, so anything
 * written next to the server was invisible to the suite. A tool nobody invokes cannot fail.
 *
 * These call it. Each one goes through the real tool, not a copy of its logic.
