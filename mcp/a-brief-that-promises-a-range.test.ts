/**
 * A tool that promises a valid range must not go quiet when it has not got one.
 *
 * `oracle_brief`'s description says it returns "its units and VALID RANGE" — capitalised, because
 * the tool exists to be the difference between "a calculator that renders and one that is
 * correct". Across the graph, 141 of 177 quantities have units and no recorded range, and the
 * field was simply absent for all of them.
 *
 * An absent field reads as "no constraint". That is the worst possible default for the one thing
 * this tool is for: unbounded inputs are the fastest way to make a correct formula give a wrong
 * answer, and the caller had nothing to tell them the bound was unknown rather than infinite.
 *
 * Nothing here fills the gap in. A bound nobody has recorded has to come from the wiki or the game,
 * and inventing one is the specific failure this package's contract forbids above all others. What
 * a tool CAN do is say the gap is there, and what `oracle_coverage` can do is count it per
 * compartment so it is a number that moves.
 *
 * The counts are cross-referenced against the graph rather than written down here, so this test
 * cannot drift as ranges get filled in — it can only catch the tools disagreeing with their data.
