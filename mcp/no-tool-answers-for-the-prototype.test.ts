/**
 * No tool may answer for a key that only exists on `Object.prototype`.
 *
 * Every string a tool receives is an untrusted key: it came from a model, and a model guesses
 * names. Plain member access walks the prototype chain, so `record['constructor']` is the `Object`
 * function and `record['toString']` is a function too — and `typeof fn !== 'function'` does not
 * reject either, which is exactly the guard `run_extractor` was relying on.
 *
 * What that cost, before this:
 *
 * - `run_extractor({ extractor: 'constructor' })` passed the function check, called
 *   `Object(parsedRoot)`, and returned the entire 741-key save root as that extractor's output.
 * - `get_export({ name: 'toString' })` reported `toString` as an export of `thetowersdk/data`,
 *   kind `function`. `AGENTS.md` opens with "find the export; do not invent one" — and the tool
 *   whose job is preventing invented names was confirming them.
 * - `valueOf` and `hasOwnProperty` threw raw TypeErrors out of the tool layer.
 *
 * The package already ships `hasOwnKey` for this, and its docblock describes this precise trap.
 * Thirty-three files use it. The tool surface did not, which is why this sweeps every tool rather
 * than the two that were caught: the next one will be written by someone who also did not know.
 */

/*
 * The canonical registry, not a spread assembled here.
 *
 * This file first read `TOOLS` alone and reported "oracle_get is not registered" instead of testing
 * it. Fixing that by spreading in the oracle tools still left the epaths registry out — and that is
 * where the last instance of this bug was hiding, in a server whose own compartment documents the
 * trap. Two rounds of the same mistake is enough to stop assembling the list by hand.

 * SUPPOSED to find near matches, and it reports `matchedExactly` so a caller can tell a real hit
 * from a fuzzy one.
 *
 * That distinction is not pedantry — `oracle_traps('constructor')` legitimately resolves to
 * `sheets.rangeNaming`, because the word appears inside a trap warning about untrusted keys
 * resolving to `Object.prototype` members. The oracle answering a prototype probe with the trap
 * about prototype probes is the system working. What would be wrong is claiming an EXACT match.
