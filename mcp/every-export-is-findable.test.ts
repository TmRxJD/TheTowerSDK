/**
 * If a tool says "call this export, do not reimplement it", the export has to be findable.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` rule 8 is "never invent export names — list_exports / get_export", and
 * `oracle_brief` introduces `implementedBy` as "the SDK exports that already implement it (call
 * these — do not reimplement)". Both instructions point at the same two tools.
 *
 * Those tools searched six entry points. The package publishes thirteen. So an agent doing exactly
 * what it was told found that `MODULE_CURRENCIES`, `ULTIMATE_WEAPON_STATS` and `DAMAGE_FORMULA`
 * "do not exist" — and 202 of the oracle's 349 `implementedBy` names came back as missing, because
 * most of them live in `knowledge`, which was not on the list.
 *
 * The failure is worse than an unhelpful error. An agent told an export does not exist does the
 * thing the instruction was written to prevent: it writes its own.
 *
 * Both checks derive their expectations — one from `package.json`, one from the graph — so neither
 * can drift as entry points and nodes are added.
