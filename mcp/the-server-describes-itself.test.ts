/**
 * The tool that says what tools exist must not leave one out.
 *
 * `list_modules` is how an agent orients: it is the first call, and whatever it does not mention
 * effectively does not exist. It reported `toolCount: 49` beside three modules listing 48 tools
 * between them — the missing one being `list_modules` itself, tagged `module: 'meta'` against a
 * `MODULES` map that had no `meta` entry.
 *
 * Nothing caught it, and the reason is worth keeping. There WAS a self-check: `toolCount` against
 * `expectedToolCount`. But `expectedToolCount` is `ALLOW.length + 1` and `toolCount` was
 * `Object.keys(merged).length` — both derived from the REGISTRATION, neither from the LISTING. Two
 * numbers that cannot disagree, guarding a third thing that had already drifted. That is a guard
 * shaped like a guard.
 *
 * So this compares the enumeration against the registration, which are the two things that can
 * actually come apart.
 *
 * The slim server lives in the development monorepo; a published copy has only `mcp/server.mjs`,
 * so this skips there rather than inventing a path.

/**
 * Read the listing through a plain `node`, once, rather than importing the server here.
 *
 * Vitest's transform cannot load this file — it is ESM with top-level await that reaches across
 * the monorepo, and importing it from a test throws `Invalid or unexpected token` before any
 * assertion runs. Node itself loads it without complaint, which is also how it is actually run.
 *
 * One spawn, at module scope, shared by every case. An earlier determinism test in this package
 * spawned `npx tsx` per case from inside a worker and tore down the worker's IPC channel under
 * load; `node -e` is a fraction of that and happens once.
