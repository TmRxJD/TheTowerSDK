/**
 * Two oracle tools describing the same graph must not disagree about what is in it.
 *
 * `oracle_coverage` lists compartments — `bots`, `modules`, `cards` — with a node count each, and
 * `oracle_map` is the tool you would naturally call next to see one. It filtered by entity id
 * PREFIX, and the ids inside those compartments are `bot.`, `module.` and `card.`. So the obvious
 * second call returned an empty graph for **17 of 29 compartments**, and a fraction of itself for
 * five more: `attack` gave 1 node of 7, because `multishot` and `rapidFire` do not start with
 * "attack".
 *
 * Nothing failed, and nothing could have. `{ counts: { nodes: 0, edges: 0 } }` is a well-formed
 * answer, indistinguishable from a family that genuinely holds nothing — the trap this very graph
 * documents about spreadsheets ("an empty result and a mistyped tab name are indistinguishable"),
 * reproduced in the tool that serves the graph.
 *
 * The check is a cross-reference rather than a restatement: every compartment `oracle_coverage`
 * reports must be retrievable from `oracle_map`, at the size `oracle_coverage` claims. Neither
 * side's number is written down here, so the test cannot drift with them — it can only catch them
 * disagreeing.
