/**
 * The wiki drift check must ask every wiki, and must be able to reach them.
 *
 * It called `fetchFandomPageAsMarkdown`. Two failure modes followed, and only the first was loud:
 *
 * - A page that lives only on Game Vault read as "wiki page not found" — `Lab`, whose full boost
 *   cost table is the source of the 20%-per-boosted-lab scaling.
 * - A page Fandom carries as an EMPTY STUB was fetched, hashed, and reported unchanged, while the
 *   table it exists to watch sits on the other site. A stub is a successful fetch. Nothing
 *   distinguished it from the real page, so the report said `ok` about pages it was not reading.
 *
 * With every wiki asked and the curl transport available, 22 of 58 pages come back from Game Vault
 * — including Bounce Shot, Multishot and Rend Armor, the three the SDK's own docblock on
 * `fetchWikiPageFromAnySource` names as the reason that function exists. The lesson had been
 * learned and written down; this caller never picked it up.
 *
 * Both halves are load-bearing and both are asserted. The multi-source fetch alone is not enough:
 * Game Vault's edge blocks the platform fetch, so without `createCurlFetch` every Game Vault
 * attempt errors and the fetch silently falls back to Fandom — the stub problem, restored.
