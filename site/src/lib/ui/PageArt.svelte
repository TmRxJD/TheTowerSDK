	 *
	 * One image behind a two-thousand-pixel page means the reader sees the same surface for the
	 * whole scroll, so a long document looks like it is not moving. This advances the backdrop at
	 * the section boundaries the page already has — its headings — so the change lands where the
	 * subject changes rather than at an arbitrary pixel count.
	 *
	 * Two stacked layers, not one: swapping `background-image` on a single element cuts, and a cut
	 * behind body copy reads as a glitch. The inactive layer is loaded and faded up underneath, so
	 * the change is a cross-fade with no flash of the page's own colour between images.
	 *
	 * The starting tile comes from the route, so a page keeps the backdrop a returning reader
	 * remembers, and the nav pages are each given a different one outright — see `$lib/art`.
