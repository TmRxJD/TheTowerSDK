	/**
	 * The creator code, as it appears on the Run Tracker's header.
	 *
	 * Using the code in the in-game webstore supports the project at no cost to the player, so the
	 * button states the code rather than explaining it — the whole thing has to read in the width of
	 * a header slot, and anyone who does not already know what a creator code is will not be
	 * persuaded by two more words.
	 *
	 * Rebuilt rather than copied. The tracker's is Vuetify (`v-btn`, `v-avatar`) and this site is
	 * Svelte with Tailwind tokens; porting the markup would have dragged a component library in for
	 * one button. The design is the same — game logo, small label stacked over the code — because
	 * the two sites should look like the same hand made them.
	 *
	 * `variant` exists because the footer needs the same object at a different weight: quieter,
	 * inline with the other footer links, and not competing with the header's copy of itself.
	 *
	 * `tower-logo.webp` is a copy of `tower-assets/assets/site/towerlogo.webp`, the same asset the
	 * Run Tracker's header uses, so the two headers cannot drift apart.
	 *
	 * That asset used to ship with its background baked in and no alpha channel at all — a dark
	 * brown square that read as a tile sitting on the bar. Both copies are now the alpha cut. The
	 * art is neon glow on that ground and there is no edge to key against, so the cut is by
	 * luminance: the background tops out around L=26 and the glow runs to L=255, and the result is
	 * unpremultiplied so compositing reproduces the original over a dark ground. It assumes a dark
	 * ground for exactly that reason — on a light one the glow has nothing to read against, which
	 * is fine for both of these sites and would not be for a third.
