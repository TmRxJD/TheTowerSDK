 * The SDK's own manifest, not the copy in node_modules.
 *
 * The site sits inside the SDK repository, so `../../../package.json` is the version being
 * released — it is current the moment the version is bumped, with no install step in between.
 * Reading the installed copy instead meant the site advertised whatever `site/package.json`
 * happened to pin, which is one more thing to remember on every release.
 *
 * Named import, not a default import of the whole manifest: Vite's JSON plugin emits each
 * top-level key as its own export, so this ships the version string alone. A default import
 * inlined the entire package.json — scripts, devDependencies and all — into the client bundle.
