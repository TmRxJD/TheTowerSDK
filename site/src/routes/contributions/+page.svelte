<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Contributions</h1>
<p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-muted">
	Most of what this package knows was worked out by other people. The Effective Paths formulas are a
	community spreadsheet's maths. The save file's enum indexes were mapped by someone who did that
	work first. Some of the earliest game data began in an older toolkit. The wiki pages are
	volunteers' writing. This package translates all of it into TypeScript, which is a far smaller job
	than producing it.

<h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Community Guides</h2>
<p class="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-muted">
	The knowledge graph carries claims the game never states and no file contains — what a mechanic is
	worth in practice, the magnitudes behind it, the words players use for it. Those come from guides
	somebody wrote and keeps current. Each one below is cited by the graph itself, and a test checks
	that it still is, so nothing is credited here for work the package did not take.
</p>
<div class="mt-4 space-y-3">
	{#each COMMUNITY_GUIDES as guide (guide.graphRef)}
		<div class="tool-card">
			<div class="flex flex-wrap items-baseline justify-between gap-3">
				<h3 class="font-medium">
					{#if guide.url}
						<a href={guide.url} rel="noreferrer">{guide.title}</a>

		</div>
	{/each}
</div>
<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-muted">
	If a guide you wrote informs something here and is not listed, that is an omission rather than a
	decision — <a href={LINKS.github}>open an issue</a> and it will be added.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">The Wikis</h2>
<p class="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-muted">
	Individual editors are not listed, deliberately. Wiki authorship changes continuously and is
	recorded per page in each wiki's own history, so a snapshot copied into a package would be wrong
	within a week and would quietly drop people. Every page the SDK returns carries a
	<code>url</code> back to its source, where the authors and the edit history are.
</p>
<ul class="mt-4 flex flex-wrap gap-2">
	{#each WIKI_CREDIT_SOURCES as source (source.url)}
		<li class="rounded-md border border-line/70 px-3 py-1 text-sm">
			<a href={source.url} rel="noreferrer">{source.label}</a>
		</li>
	{/each}
</ul>

<h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Supporting Them Directly</h2>
<p class="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-muted">
	Tech Tree Games' webstore credits a creator code on purchase, so entering one sends support at no
	extra cost to you. It is the one way this package can give back for formulas it did not write.
</p>
<ul class="mt-4 space-y-2">
	{#each CONTRIBUTION_SUPPORT as support (support.creatorCode)}
		<li class="text-sm">
			<span class="text-fg">{support.label}</span>

			<span class="text-muted"> at </span>
			<a href={support.storeUrl} rel="noreferrer">the webstore</a>
		</li>
	{/each}
</ul>

<h2 class="mt-12 text-xl font-semibold">Rendering This In Your Own Tool</h2>
<p class="mt-2 max-w-3xl text-muted">
	If your tool shows Effective Paths numbers or wiki text, this is the credit to carry. The roster
	ships with the package, so the list stays right as it grows.
</p>
<div class="mt-4">
	<CodeBlock
