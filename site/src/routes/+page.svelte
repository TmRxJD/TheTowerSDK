	The hero is a full-bleed stage, not a block in the content column.

	Every previous attempt at "make this pop" adjusted colour inside the same narrow centered column,
	which is why none of them changed the impression the page makes. The first screen now belongs to
	the hero: it runs edge to edge, stands nearly a full viewport tall, and rotates through several
	answers to what the package is for.

	`HERO_IMAGE` is the one piece that is not authored here — see the note on the constant.

<!--
	`-mt-10` cancels the `py-10` on `<main>` in the layout.

	`full-bleed` only escapes the horizontal gutter, so the hero still sat below main's top padding —
