# TheTowerSDK

Game data and save-file reading for **The Tower**, so you can build your own calculators, trackers,
spreadsheets, charts and planners.

### 📖 [Documentation, live demos and runnable examples → thetowersdk website](https://tmrxjd.github.io/TheTowerSDK/)

```bash
npm install thetowersdk
```

- **Game data** — labs, workshop, modules, cards, perks, relics, guardians, bots, ultimate weapons
  and the vault, with their cost curves and effect values, as typed arrays.
- **Save reading** — turn a player's `playerInfo.dat` into typed values: what they've researched,
  what they own, what's equipped, their run history.
- **Formulas** — enemy scaling, damage, ultimates, drops, workshop stats: the calculation layer
  behind the Run Tracker's own calculators.
- **Charts** — every level progression is already a plot-ready series, so the shipped catalogs cover
  [786 chartable series](#charts) without you authoring a single one.

TypeScript, one runtime dependency (`zod`), MIT licensed.

## Quick Start

### Use The Game Data

```ts
import { LAB_CATALOG } from 'thetowersdk/data'

const costToMax = (lab) => lab.levels.reduce((sum, level) => sum + level.cost, 0)

const priciest = LAB_CATALOG
  .map((lab) => ({ name: lab.name, total: costToMax(lab) }))
  .sort((a, b) => b.total - a.total)[0]
```

Every `cost` is a plain number of coins. There is no scaling factor to apply and no currency field
to read first — a lab that costs 1.1 quadrillion is `1.1e15`, so you can add two labs together
without checking where either came from.

### Read a Save File

```ts
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { decodePlayerInfoSaveBytes } from 'thetowersdk/node'
import { readLabsFromSaveRoot } from 'thetowersdk/save'

const { parsedRoot } = decodePlayerInfoSaveBytes(await readFile('playerInfo.dat'))

const labs = readLabsFromSaveRoot(parsedRoot)
console.log(`${labs.researchedCount} researched, ${labs.maxedCount} maxed`)
```

Decode once, then extract whatever you need.

---

## How It Fits Together

```
playerInfo.dat ──decodePlayerInfoSaveBytes()──► save root (plain object)
                                                     │
                     ┌───────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┐
                     ▼                               ▼                              ▼
           readLabsFromSaveRoot()   readModulesFromSaveRoot()   discoverSaveImportTrackers()
                     │                               │                              │
                     ▼                               ▼                              ▼
               typed lab data                 typed module data          "what's in this save?"
```

The **save root** is a plain JavaScript object. Extractors read from it and never modify it, so you
can run as many as you like over the same root.

## Entry Points

| Import | Contains | Browser-safe |
|---|---|---|
| `thetowersdk/data` | Game tables — costs, levels, effects, catalogs | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/save` | `extract*FromSaveRoot()` and save inspection | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/node` | The save decoder | Node — [see below](#decoding-in-a-browser) |
| `thetowersdk/formatting` | Number and duration formatting matching the game | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/mechanics` | Game formulas — see [below](#formulas) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/wiki` | Fandom wikitext → Markdown — see [below](#reading-the-community-wiki) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/charts` | Curated chart catalog and its data — see [below](#charts) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/builders` | Ready-made calculators — see [below](#builders) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/bot` | Command registry, and every calculator as a command — see [below](#building-a-bot-on-this) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/sheets` | Google Sheets reads and writes — see [below](#google-sheets) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/knowledge` | The mechanics oracle, and five years of patch notes — see [below](#patch-notes) | Yes |
| `thetowersdk/assets` | Path helpers for artwork **you supply** — see [below](#using-your-own-artwork) | Yes |

Game data lives here, not in the consuming application. Relic unlock methods and
bonus totals, theme categories and their coin coefficients, vault tree
summaries, daily-mission reward tables and the module pull simulator all moved
out of `@tmrxjd/platform` into `thetowersdk/data`. What stayed behind is prose —
the explanatory text an assistant reads — because that is documentation of a
game, not a number anyone calculates with.

`import { … } from 'thetowersdk'` re-exports `data`, `save` and `formatting` together. Prefer the
subpaths in real projects so your bundler can drop what you don't use.

```ts
import { computeWaveBaseHealth, abilityDamage } from 'thetowersdk/mechanics'
import { formatDuration } from 'thetowersdk/formatting'
```

## Reading a Save

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `readLabsFromSaveRoot` | Research levels, what's maxed, the active queue |
| `readWorkshopFromSaveRoot` | Upgrade levels, enhancements, saved presets |
| `readModulesFromSaveRoot` | Owned modules, rarities, substats, equipped |
| `readCardsFromSaveRoot` | Card levels, copies, mastery, equipped slots |
| `readGuardiansFromSaveRoot` | Guardian levels and upgrades |
| `readBotsFromSaveRoot` | Bot levels, plus/sync unlocks, medals spent |
| `readUltimateWeaponsFromSaveRoot` | UW levels, unlocks, plus-levels, stones |
| `readVaultFromSaveRoot` | Vault power tree progress |
| `readRelicsFromSaveRoot` | Owned relics |
| `readCollectedThemeNamesFromSaveRoot` | Unlocked themes |
| `readLifetimeFromSaveRoot` | Lifetime totals |
| `readDissonanceFromSaveRoot` | Dissonance echo progress |
| `listImportableBattleRuns` | Run history |

Plus perks, "killed by" and per-run battle report fields — see [`src/save/index.ts`](src/save/index.ts).

### Check Before You Read

Extractors return `null` when a save has no data for that feature, rather than throwing, so older
saves degrade instead of failing:

```ts
const labs = readLabsFromSaveRoot(parsedRoot)
if (!labs) return

if (labs.warnings.length) {
  // Values the extractor could not interpret. Usually means the save shape changed.
  console.warn(labs.warnings)
}
```

### What's In This Save?

```ts
import { discoverSaveImportTrackers } from 'thetowersdk/save'

for (const found of discoverSaveImportTrackers(parsedRoot).trackers) {
  console.log(`${found.label}: ${found.count} — ${found.summary}`)
}
// Labs: 166 — 166 labs found in save
// Modules: 25 — 25 modules found in save
```

Useful for showing someone what you found before doing anything with it.

### Run History And Battle Reports

Every completed run the game kept is available, with all of its stored fields:

```ts
import { listImportableBattleRuns, buildBattleReportStatFields } from 'thetowersdk/save'

const runs = listImportableBattleRuns(parsedRoot)

// The raw entry — tier, wave, duration, coins, cells, damage dealt and taken,
// per-source damage breakdowns, what killed you, and everything else the game
// recorded for that run.
console.log(Object.keys(runs[0]))

// Or the same run flattened into named stat fields.
const stats = buildBattleReportStatFields(runs[0])
```

`listImportableBattleRuns` hands back the decoded entries themselves, not a filtered view, so you
are not limited to the fields this SDK happens to name. There are also helpers for duration
formatting, date parsing and deduplication — see [`src/save/index.ts`](src/save/index.ts).

### Reading Any Field In a Save

`parsedRoot` is the decoded file as a plain object, so every field the game stores is yours to read
directly. The named extractors are a convenience layer over that same object — reach past them
whenever you want a field they do not name.

Values are loosely typed and arrays arrive in several shapes, so use the readers rather than
hand-parsing:

```ts
import { coerceSaveNumber, readSaveBoolean, readSaveIntList } from 'thetowersdk/save'

coerceSaveNumber(parsedRoot.someKey) // number | null
readSaveBoolean(parsedRoot.someFlag) // boolean
readSaveIntList(parsedRoot.someList) // number[]
```

Worked out a field that isn't covered? A PR adding an extractor is very welcome.

---

## Reading The Community Wiki

The Tower's wiki is on Fandom, which serves **wikitext** rather than anything you can render:
templates, infoboxes, `[[File:…]]` links and vertical wikitables. This converts it to Markdown.

```ts
import { fetchFandomPageAsMarkdown } from 'thetowersdk/wiki'

const markdown = await fetchFandomPageAsMarkdown('Cards')
```

Or the halves separately, if you fetch pages your own way — from a cache, a mirror, or a build step:

```ts
import { convertFandomWikitextToMarkdown, resolveFandomFileImages } from 'thetowersdk/wiki'

const markdown = convertFandomWikitextToMarkdown(wikitext, { pageTitle: 'Cards' })
```

A page that does not exist returns `200 OK` with a `missing` marker rather than a 404, so
`fetchFandomWikitext` throws on it instead of returning an empty page.

**The conversion ships here; the wiki's content does not.** Wiki text is CC-BY-SA and this package
is MIT, so fetch what you need and honor the wiki's license in whatever you ship. It is a
volunteer-run wiki — cache what you fetch, and space out requests when pulling many pages.

## Getting a Save File

`playerInfo.dat` is The Tower's save file.

- **Android** — `Android/data/com.TechTreeGames.TheTower/files/playerInfo.dat`
- **Android emulator** (BlueStacks, LDPlayer, WSA…) — the same path inside the emulated device
- **macOS** — the native App Store build stores it in its app container under
  `~/Library/Containers/<bundle-id>/Data/Library/Application Support/…`, with non-sandboxed installs
  under `~/Library/Application Support/…`
- **iOS** — inside an encrypted device backup; not practical to read directly

On Windows the save always comes from an emulator. On a Mac the native build is right there on disk.

Copying that file by hand is the tedious part of building anything save-driven, so
[**adb-bridge**](https://github.com/TmRxJD/adb-bridge) removes the step. It talks to a connected
phone or a running emulator over ADB, or reads the macOS container directly, and hands the bytes
straight to whatever needs them:

```bash
npx adb-bridge
```

- Installs Google's official platform-tools for you if `adb` isn't already on the machine (Android
  only — the macOS path needs no tooling).
- Serves the save to a local page over a WebSocket bound to `127.0.0.1`, so a browser app can read a
  real account with no upload step and no file picker.
- Can watch the save and re-send it whenever the game writes, which keeps a tracker live while you
  play instead of forcing a manual re-import.
- Pulls only. It never modifies anything on the device, needs no root, and touches only the games you
  enable.
- One install covers multiple games — adding another registers it with the bridge you already have.

Feed the bytes it gives you to `decodePlayerInfoSaveBytes` and everything above applies unchanged.

> Save files are personal data. If your tool uploads them anywhere, tell your users plainly.

### Decoding In a Browser

The decoder is in `thetowersdk/node` only because it uses `node:zlib`. In a browser, gunzip with
`DecompressionStream` and call the NRBF reader directly — both are exported and pure:

```ts
import { NRBFReader, nrbfToJSON } from 'thetowersdk/node'

async function decodeInBrowser (file: File): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  let bytes = new Uint8Array(await file.arrayBuffer())
  if (bytes[0] === 0x1f && bytes[1] === 0x8b) {
    const stream = new Blob([bytes]).stream().pipeThrough(new DecompressionStream('gzip'))
    bytes = new Uint8Array(await new Response(stream).arrayBuffer())
  }
  return nrbfToJSON(NRBFReader.readStream(bytes)) as Record<string, unknown>
}
```

Everything in `thetowersdk/save` and `thetowersdk/data` then works on the result unchanged.

---

## Builders

Ready-made calculators. Each one pairs the maths in `thetowersdk/mechanics` with the things a tool
needs around it and never gets for free: a complete set of defaults, a description of every input,
normalisation of whatever half-filled state a form is in, and a result that says what it could not
work out.

```ts
import { labResearchCalculator } from 'thetowersdk/builders'

const result = labResearchCalculator.compute({ labName: 'Damage', targetLevel: 10 })
console.log(result.totalCoinCost, result.totalHours)
for (const note of result.notes) console.warn(note)
```

`compute` takes a `Partial` on purpose — a form hands you half-filled state constantly, and a
calculator that throws or returns `NaN` on that pushes the problem back into the UI.

Render a form without knowing which calculator it is:

```ts
for (const field of labResearchCalculator.fields) {
  // field.kind is 'number' | 'select' | 'boolean' | 'number-list'
}
```

| Builder | Answers |
|---|---|
| `labResearchCalculator` | Coins and time to take a lab from one level to another |
| `workshopUpgradeCalculator` | Coins to move a workshop stat between two levels |
| `moduleCostCalculator` | Shards and coins to level a module, capped by its rarity |
| `ultimateWeaponCalculator` | Power Stones for an ultimate weapon stat |
| `uptimeCalculator` | What share of the time an ability is actually running |
| `guardianCalculator` | Bits for a guardian stat |
| `botUpgradeCalculator` | Medals for a bot stat |
| `enemyWaveCalculator` | Health and damage per enemy kind at a tier and wave |
| `damageReductionCalculator` | What reaches the tower after every mitigation layer |
| `assistModuleStonesCalculator` | Stones for an assist efficiency slot |
| `coinsPerKillCalculator` | What one enemy pays, all six bonus sources applied |
| `thornsCalculator` | Damage returned to an enemy on contact |
| `dissonanceCalculator` | The multiplier your tier personal bests apply to a stat |
| `enemyDropsCalculator` | Module drop chances, reroll shards, shatter shards |
| `innerLandMinesCalculator` | Mine damage, count, cooldown, and what charge time is worth |

`CALCULATOR_BUILDERS` is all of them, and `findCalculatorBuilder(id)` looks one up — enough to
build a calculator picker that needs no per-calculator code at all.

They wrap `thetowersdk/mechanics` rather than reimplementing it, so a correction to a formula
reaches every tool without anyone re-deriving it.

### Caps, clamps and level indexing

Every builder handles these the same way, so a number means the same thing whichever one produced it.

| Rule | How |
|---|---|
| **A level is capped by its own catalog** | `clampLevel(value, cap, fallback)`, where `cap` comes from the curve that stat actually uses |
| **An open-ended quantity is bounded so the result stays finite** | `clampMagnitude(value, fallback)`, bounded by `MAX_INPUT_MAGNITUDE` |
| **A level buys against the previous row** | `costIndexForLevel(level)` — buying level L reads entry L−1 |
| **Anything only a formula bounds gets a named constant** | e.g. `MAX_MODEL_WAVE`, where the wave curve stops producing a real number |
| **Clamping is reported** | the result's `notes` say what was clamped and to what |

Caps come from the data rather than a shared constant because the curves genuinely differ: workshop
Attack Speed prices 75 levels, Enemy Level Skip 60, Damage 400. Level indexing follows tower-oracle
`workshop.upgradeTable`: a cost row buys the **next** level, so entry L is what is charged at level L
and buying level L costs entry L−1.

### Lookups by a name you did not choose

Ids, slugs and level indices arrive from saves, from the community sheet, from URLs and from tool
arguments. Lookups keyed by them use own-key access (`ownLookup`) for records and a
bounds-and-integer check (`atIndex`) for arrays, so an unknown key returns `undefined` rather than
whatever sits on `Object.prototype`.

The reason it is a rule rather than a caution: `record['constructor']` is the `Object` function and
`record['toString']` is a function, and neither `??` nor `||` nor a truthiness check will reject one.
The fallback simply never fires, and a function travels on from a signature that promised a string.

Cost ladders are bounded the same way, by the table rather than by the caller: a level past the end
of a curve is excluded rather than priced at zero.

npx tsx examples/12-show-module-and-card-art.ts                # which image belongs to which module
```

The third is the one to read if you are building something: it goes save → extractors → planner,
maps a player onto the model, and reports what it could not map rather than passing a silent zero
into the plan. They are type-checked against the package on every `npm run verify`.

---

## Templates

Starting points to copy into your own project, rather than scripts to read. Each is complete,
type-checked against the package source, and commented where the shape of the SDK is easy to
get wrong.

| File | For | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| [`save-cli.ts`](templates/save-cli.ts) | A command-line tool that reads a player's save | Node |
| [`browser-widget.ts`](templates/browser-widget.ts) | A UI module with no Node built-ins anywhere | Browser |
| [`calculator.ts`](templates/calculator.ts) | A calculator: typed input, pure compute, separate formatting | Either |
| [`bot-starter.ts`](templates/bot-starter.ts) | A complete bot: every calculator, a hand-written command, a CLI | Node |
| [`sheets-client.ts`](templates/sheets-client.ts) | The googleapis adapter for `thetowersdk/sheets` | Node |

### The three things they encode

**Decode once.** `decodePlayerInfoSaveBytes` is the only step that needs Node. The save root it
returns is a plain object that extractors read and never mutate, so run as many as you like over
one root.

**Only `thetowersdk/node` needs Node.** `data`, `save`, `formatting`, `mechanics`, `wiki`,
`charts` and `knowledge` are all browser-safe. A widget that never opens a save file
never imports the decoder — that is why `browser-widget.ts` exists as a separate file.

**Say what you could not do.** Extractors return `null` for features a save predates and carry a
`warnings` array; `calculator.ts` returns a `notes` array for the same reason. A planner that
silently returns `0` for an unknown lab is worse than one that says it does not know the lab.

### Two traps these avoid

- **Durations are text, and not all one shape.** Most catalog rows are `"HH:MM:SS"` with hours
  running past 24 (`"500:00:00"`), but some are `"0s"`. Use `parseDurationToHours`; splitting on
  `":"` yourself returns `NaN` on the `"0s"` rows and poisons the whole sum.
- **Format with the game's ladder.** If your tool prints `1.4e21` where the game prints `1.4s`,
  a player cannot check your answer against their screen — and that is the only way they can
  trust it. `formatLargeNumber` and `parseResource` round-trip.

---

## Names And Acronyms

The game and the community use a lot of shorthand, and plenty of it collides. `CF` is Chrono Field
to one player and critical factor to another; `GC` is Galaxy Compressor or glass cannon. The SDK
ships a glossary of 233 terms so you do not have to guess:

```ts
import { lookupGlossary, expandAcronym, listAmbiguousGlossaryTerms } from 'thetowersdk/data'

expandAcronym('CF')      // 'Chrono Field'
expandAcronym('GC')      // 'Galaxy Compressor'

lookupGlossary('CF')[0]  // { term, kind, domain: 'ultimate-weapon', expansion, definition }
listAmbiguousGlossaryTerms()   // 13 terms that resolve to more than one thing
```

Each entry carries a `domain`, which is usually enough to pick the one you meant. Usually, not
always: `SR` returns both Shrink Ray and Solar Reflector and *both* are modules, so for the terms in
`listAmbiguousGlossaryTerms()` you need the `expansion` rather than the domain.

The glossary only covers what the game calls things. Community shorthand that never became a game
name — critical factor for `CF`, glass cannon for `GC` — is not in it, so `expandAcronym` gives you
the game's meaning and nothing else.

Names in it are generated from the same catalogs the SDK ships, and every acronym is checked against
those names, so a term cannot appear unless it is real.

## Using It With An AI Agent

There's an MCP server in [`mcp/`](mcp/README.md). Point your agent at it and it can read the real
API and the real game data instead of guessing at both.

```bash
claude mcp add thetowersdk -- node ./node_modules/thetowersdk/mcp/server.mjs
```

Any MCP client works — it speaks stdio.

**Tracker monorepo:** register the **slim pair** (not the full CI harness):

| Server | Entry | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `tower` | `tools/tower-mcp/mechanics-server.mjs` | Mechanics (wiki, SDK graph, epaths) |
| `tower-gov` | `tools/tower-mcp/gov-server.mjs` | CAP, Staging, Enforcement, Schema, Pointer, Confidence |

Do **not** also register the standalone package MCP or `tools/tower-mcp/server.mjs` in the IDE — that overflows CallMcpTool and duplicates tools. After changing MCP config or `TOWER_SLIM_CATALOG_REV`, reload both servers. Standalone package consumers can still use this sdk-only entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thetowersdk": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./node_modules/thetowersdk/mcp/server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Tool | Ask it for |
|---|---|
| `list_exports` · `get_export` | What exists, and one table previewed rather than dumped |
| `describe_schema` | A table's declared shape, not one guessed from a sample row |
| `decode_save` · `run_extractor` | What is in a `playerInfo.dat`, and one extractor's output |
| `define_term` | What an acronym means, and whether it is ambiguous |
| `plan_effective_path` | An Effective Path, with the candidates it left out and why |
| `wiki_search` · `wiki_page` | How a mechanic actually behaves, from the community wiki |
| `begin_mechanic_task` · `record_*` | Mechanics compliance session + map/ledger |
| `sdk_graph_*` · `trust_coverage_report` · `trust_drift_check` | Mechanics graph SoT + TrustReport + drift aggregate |
| `sdk_graph_render` · `ep_graph_render` | The graph as a **Mermaid** diagram — paste straight into Markdown |
| `sdk_kernel_load` · `sdk_registry_get` · `mcp_contract` | Unified MechanicsContext + Registry TOC + MCP taxonomy |
| `ep_graph_*` · sheet oracle tools | Effective Paths sheet-backed work (`sheet_info`, `eval_formula`, …) |

Governance commits (`commit_*`, `enforcement_*`, `schema_*`, `pointer_*`) live on a separate `tower-gov` server, not on this mechanics server. The governance engine is not part of this package and is not published with it.

Doctor / debug / sandbox tools are on the **full** CI harness (`tools/tower-mcp/server.mjs`) or CLIs (`pnpm sdk-doctor`, `pnpm debug-graph:*`, …), not the slim IDE `tower` catalog.

### The Tower Oracle

A knowledge graph of game mechanics, shipped with the package as its own MCP module. Nodes are
mechanics, edges are the relationships between them, and every claim carries its source and whether
anything here has verified it. It answers how a mechanic behaves, what it interacts with, and the
specific ways it has been misread before.

| Tool | Ask it for |
|---|---|
| `oracle_traps` | **Call this first.** Every known way this mechanic has been got wrong |
| `oracle_expand` | What an acronym means, from a closed set — `GT+`, `CF`, `DW`, `BH` |
| `oracle_brief` | A short orientation on a mechanic before you model it |
| `oracle_get` · `oracle_search` | One node in full, or find the node by phrasing |
| `oracle_map` | How a mechanic connects to the rest of the game |
| `oracle_footguns` | Cross-cutting mistakes not tied to one mechanic |
| `oracle_coverage` | How well a compartment is actually covered |
| `oracle_contradictions` | Claims that disagree, ranked by source authority |

Three properties shape how you read its answers:

- **`claimType`** marks every claim `objective` or `sentiment`, keeping measured values and community
  opinion distinguishable.
- **`oracle_coverage`** reports how well a compartment is covered, so an empty `oracle_traps` result
  can be read as *unexercised* or as *clean* rather than guessed at.
- **`oracle_contradictions`** surfaces claims that disagree, ranked by source authority
  (`game` › `save` › `code` › `user` › `sheet` › `wiki` › `external-repo`), and returns both values.

`oracle_expand` resolves acronyms from a closed set, so an unknown shorthand returns as unknown.

### The Sheet Oracle

Reads a live Google Sheet, so an agent can work from a spreadsheet's own calculations:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sheet_info` | **Call first.** Sheet id, version, whether it is writable, and its known traps |
| `read_range` | Values or formulas, in A1 notation |
| `eval_formula` | **The oracle proper.** Evaluate a formula *in the sheet* and return what it computes |
| `list_lambdas` | The sheet's named functions and their parameter order |
| `inspect_tab_ui` | The live label+value control panel for a tab |
| `write_cells` | Drive inputs to a known state before reading a result |

The tools take a sheet id, so they work against any spreadsheet your service account can see:

```bash
EPATHS_SHEET_ID=<your sheet id> EPATHS_CREDENTIALS=<path to key.json>
```

Read-only tools need the sheet **shared** with the service account. `eval_formula` and `write_cells`
need edit rights, since evaluating a formula writes to a scratch cell.

#### Registering a service account

The sheet tools authenticate as a Google Cloud **service account** — a robot identity with its own
email address, which reaches the sheets you share with it.

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create or pick a project.
2. Enable the **Google Sheets API** for it.
3. **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create service account.** Access is granted per-sheet by
   sharing, so no project roles are required.
4. On the new account, **Keys → Add key → Create new key → JSON**. It downloads once. Treat it as a
   password and keep it out of version control.
5. Copy the account's email — `something@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
6. **Share your spreadsheet with that email.** Viewer is enough for reads; Editor is required for
   `eval_formula` and `write_cells`.
7. Point the tools at the key with `EPATHS_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json`.

If a read returns nothing, check the sharing first — an unshared sheet reads as an empty range
rather than a permissions error. To revoke a key, delete it in the console; sharing stays intact for
its replacement.

### Mechanics Trust & Debug Graph (monorepo)

Agents must not claim accuracy — CI and load paths do:

| Command | Role |
|---|---|
| `pnpm tower-mcp:mastery` | Fresh stdio MCP: every sdk tool happy + adversarial |
| `pnpm mechanics-kernel` | Unified MechanicsContext / validate / registry / MCP contract / save / planner / lsp |
| `pnpm save-graph:seed` | Rebuild Save Schema Graph from save modules + SAVE_*_KEY constants |
| `pnpm mechanics-docs` | Generate `docs/mechanics-map/generated/*` from kernel/registry |
| `pnpm mechanics-sandbox` | Instrumented non-destructive substrate checks |
| `pnpm sdk-doctor` | SDK Doctor diagnose (trust + debug + drift snapshots) — see `docs/AGENT_SDK_DOCTOR_PROTOCOL.md` |
| `pnpm mechanics-trust:check` | Strict TrustReport (invariants + coverage silent gaps + debug cross-check) |
| `pnpm mechanics-trust:drift` | Sheets + wiki + save drift → `docs/mechanics-map/drift/latest.json` |
| `pnpm debug-graph:compile` | Rebuild Debug Graph from recursive mechanics scan |
| `pnpm mechanics-trust:seed-inventories` | Refresh sdk-modules / wiki / save coverage inventories |

Contracts: `docs/AGENT_MECHANICS_CONSTITUTION.md`, `docs/AGENT_MECHANICS_TRUST_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/AGENT_MECHANICS_KERNEL_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/AGENT_MCP_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/AGENT_DEBUG_GRAPH_PROTOCOL.md`.
Wiki shorthand titles are remapped via `scripts/mechanics-trust/wiki-title-canonical.mjs`
(e.g. `Coin Bonus` → `Workshop Enhancement/Utility/Coin Bonus`).

Two of those change how an agent works on this domain:

**`plan_effective_path`** runs any family and variant without a scratch script — `{ family:
"economy", variant: "time", steps: 5 }`. It plans from a zero config, so read it for *structure*:
which candidates a variant offers, and why the rest are excluded. Pass a wrong variant and it names
the ones that exist rather than returning an empty result.

**`sdk_graph_render`** emits **Mermaid**, not an image. That matters for the same reason the charts
below do: a diagram of how mechanics depend on each other goes stale the moment the graph changes,
and a PNG has no way to notice. Mermaid is text generated from the graph, so it re-renders correct
in any Markdown surface that speaks it — GitHub, your docs site, an agent's reply — and reviews as a
readable diff instead of a binary blob. `ep_graph_render` does the same for the Effective Paths
dependency graph.

**`wiki_page`** is the one to reach for before describing game behavior. This package supplies
values, not semantics — a table says a number changes, not what it means or what it interacts with.
`wiki_search { query }` finds the title, `wiki_page { title, section? }` reads it. Pages are cached
after first read; set `TOWER_WIKI_DIR` to a directory of `slug.md` files to serve them offline, and
every response says whether it came from `local`, `cache` or `fandom`.

Agent instructions live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which ships with the package; `CLAUDE.md` and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` point at the same file.

## Formulas

`thetowersdk/mechanics` is the calculation layer — the same one the Run Tracker's calculators use:

- **Enemy scaling** — wave/tier base health and damage, enemy type multipliers, level skip,
  elite spawn chance, wave-info panel values
- **Damage** — thorns, knockback, multishot and bounce shot, rend armor, projectile damage, crowd
  control, damage reduction, shockwave, land mines, tower fire and range
- **Ultimate weapons** — the shared hit and absorb pipeline, plus Chrono Field slow, Poison Swamp
  ticks and stun, and Inner Land Mines including Charge Mines
- **Economy** — coin and enemy drop simulation, interest, ROI scaling, workshop cost tables
- **Workshop stats** — attack, defense and utility stat tables and their build-up
- **Bots and guardians** — bot hit multipliers, effective range and coverage, Wildfire duration,
  medal planning and simulation, Bot Bot overlap, cooldowns
- **Battle conditions** — resistance levels, tournament heat, counter labs

```ts
import { computeWaveBaseHealth, abilityDamage, goldenComboBonus } from 'thetowersdk/mechanics'
```

---

## Charts

Charts are built on [the formulas above](#formulas) and the catalogs — which is the whole reason
this section follows that one. You need the numbers before you can plot them.

There is no chart API here, and that is deliberate: **a level progression already is a series.** The
level is your x-axis and each measured field on it is a line, so generating a chart is a `map`, not
an integration. A helper would only wrap `Array.map` while forcing an opinion about rendering on you.

### Why This Beats Keeping Images

The usual way a project ends up with charts is somebody makes a picture. Then the game rebalances,
or a tier gets added, and now there is a PNG showing last patch's numbers with nothing anywhere to
flag it. The image cannot tell you it is stale, so it stays wrong until a player notices.

Generating from the data inverts that. **You never make a new image — you add rows to the array and
every chart drawn from it regenerates.** One new lab level, one rebalanced cost, one extra ultimate
weapon, and every view over that data is correct at once: the cost curve, the comparison chart, the
table, the tooltip. Charts stay consistent with each other because they are not separate artifacts
that happen to agree — they are the same numbers rendered more than one way.

That is also why the graph tooling emits [Mermaid rather than images](#using-it-with-an-ai-agent):
the same argument applies to diagrams. Text regenerates; a binary does not.

```ts
import { LAB_CATALOG } from 'thetowersdk/data'

const lab = LAB_CATALOG.find((l) => l.name === 'Attack Speed')

const costCurve = lab.levels.map((l) => ({ x: l.level, y: l.cost }))
const timeCurve = lab.levels.map((l) => ({ x: l.level, y: l.duration }))
```

Hand those points to whatever already draws your charts — Chart.js, D3, Vega, a spreadsheet, an SVG
path you build yourself. The same operation across a whole catalog gives you a comparison chart:

```ts
import { uwStoneChartData } from 'thetowersdk/data'

// One series per ultimate weapon: stone cost to reach each cooldown level.
const datasets = Object.values(uwStoneChartData).map((weapon) => {
  const cooldown = weapon.stats.find((s) => s.name === 'Cooldown')
  return {
    label: weapon.name,
    data: cooldown.levels
      .filter((l) => typeof l.cost === 'number')
      .map((l) => ({ x: l.level, y: l.cost })),
  }
})
```

### A Table Is a Chart Too

Most of what players actually want is a table, not a curve — "what does the next level cost, and
what do I get for it". Same data, same `map`, different rendering:

```ts
import { uwStoneChartData } from 'thetowersdk/data'
import { formatNumberForDisplay } from 'thetowersdk/formatting'

const gt = Object.values(uwStoneChartData).find((w) => w.name === 'Golden Tower')
const multiplier = gt.stats.find((s) => s.name === 'Multiplier')

let running = 0
for (const level of multiplier.levels) {
  if (typeof level.cost === 'number') running += level.cost
  console.log(level.level, level.value, level.cost, formatNumberForDisplay(running))
}
```

```
Golden Tower — every stat

  Stat             Levels     To max  Final
  ---------------- ------  ---------  ------------
  Multiplier           21     8.434K  x21.0
  Duration             39    14.052K  53s
  Cooldown             21       4.7K  100s
  Golden Combo         15     20.07K  0.45%
```

That table is emitted, not written. When a stat gains levels or a cost is rebalanced, the table and
every chart over the same array update together — which is the point of
[generating rather than keeping images](#why-this-beats-keeping-images). The same loop emits
Markdown, so documentation tables regenerate instead of rotting.
See [`examples/05-generate-a-cost-table.ts`](examples/05-generate-a-cost-table.ts).

**How much is chartable.** The shipped catalogs support **786 distinct series** — one per measurable
field that varies across a level range:

| Source | Series | What varies |
|---|---|---|
| Labs | 450 | Coin cost and research time, per lab |
| Workshop | 141 | Stat value, cash cost, coin cost |
| Cards | 62 | Level values and mastery values |
| Ultimate weapons | 72 | Stat value and stone cost, per stat |
| Guardians | 36 | Chip stat value and cost |
| Bots | 25 | Per-stat progressions, including plus variants |

That is a floor, not a ceiling. It counts only fields that already vary by level, and excludes
catalogs with nothing to plot — relics carry a single flat value, module substats are cluster
metadata, and vault nodes are identifiers. Anything you derive from [the formulas](#formulas) is
additional.

### The Curated Catalog

`thetowersdk/charts` adds a registry of chart definitions the Run Tracker ships, for when you want
the same views rather than your own:

```ts
import { SHARED_CHART_REGISTRY, findChartByPathId } from 'thetowersdk/charts'
```

It answers *what charts exist and what is in them* — never how they look. Rendering, styling and
localisation stay with your application. `CHART_MECHANIC_LINKS` maps each chart to the entities in
`thetowersdk/knowledge` it documents, so a mechanic can find its chart and vice versa.

See [`examples/04-generate-a-chart.ts`](examples/04-generate-a-chart.ts).

## Building a Bot On This

A Tower bot answers the same few hundred questions from data that does not change between releases,
so most of it is already written:

```ts
import { calculatorCommands, createTowerBot } from 'thetowersdk/bot'

const bot = createTowerBot({ commands: calculatorCommands() })
const reply = await bot.run('lab-research', { args: { labName: 'Damage', targetLevel: 10 } })
```

`calculatorCommands()` turns every builder into a command — options, coercion, formatting and
`notes` — because each builder already describes its own inputs. A builder added to the SDK later
appears in your bot with no edit. The registry handles dispatch, argument coercion, memoising and
errors; `bot.run` never throws, so a gateway handler cannot leave someone watching a spinner until
the interaction expires.

Nothing in it knows what a gateway is, so the same commands run under discord.js, on a CLI, and at
full speed in a test.

```bash
npm run bot:demo                                            # list the commands
npm run bot:demo -- lab-research labName=Damage targetLevel=10
npm run bot:test
```

[`templates/bot-starter.ts`](templates/bot-starter.ts) is a complete bot with a hand-written command
and a CLI. [`docs/BUILDING_A_BOT.md`](docs/BUILDING_A_BOT.md) covers performance and the Discord
adapter.

### Rules that came out of running three of them

The Run Tracker ships three Discord bots alongside the website, all computing from this package. The
rules below came out of getting that wrong first, and almost none of them are Discord-specific —
they apply to Slack, Telegram, Matrix, or anything else built around callbacks with opaque ids.

**Treat the bot as a first-class client, not a bolt-on.** Domain logic — parsing, normalization,
cost math, run shapes — belongs in a shared package that both the bot and your UI import. Only
platform glue (embeds, components, modals, collectors) lives in the bot repo. The failure this
prevents is subtle and expensive: a bot that reimplements a calculation drifts from the website, and
now the same question has two answers depending on where a player asks it. That is the whole reason
this SDK is framework-agnostic.

**One router.** Every interaction dispatches through a single entry point, with persistent handlers
registered against it. Scattered per-feature listeners are how you get two handlers responding to
one click, and the second one erroring because the first already replied.

**Component ids get exactly one owner.** Build *and* parse them in one module, and let handlers
consume parsed values only. A custom id is a wire format — it is serialized, handed to a remote
client, and handed back later, possibly after your process restarted. Once a handler does
`split(':')` inline, the format is defined in as many places as it is read, and adding a field
breaks callers nobody remembered. Registry lookup should use exact or longest-prefix matching for
the same reason, never `slice(prefix.length)` at each call site.

**Interactions are owned.** Wait on a modal by filtering on the component id **and** the initiating
user. Without both, one user's click resolves another user's pending wait — a bug that never appears
in single-user testing and appears constantly in a busy channel.

**Guard tokens before touching session state.** Anything carrying a session token must check it is
present and unexpired first. Callbacks arrive late, arrive twice, and arrive after a redeploy;
treating an expired token as a valid one corrupts state rather than erroring.

**Support every component kind from the start.** Buttons, all select-menu variants, and modals —
even when the current feature only uses one. Retrofitting a router that assumed buttons is worse
than writing it general, and it is a small amount of extra work up front.

**Stay quiet when the interaction is not yours.** An unregistered submission that belongs to a
command-local ownership flow should return silently, not log an error or reply. Otherwise normal
operation fills your logs with noise and hides the real failures.

**Keep the probe scripts.** Diagnostic tooling — "what does this record actually look like in the
database" — belongs in a checked-in `scripts/` directory, not in a throwaway file. You will need it
again, and next time it will be during an incident.

## Google Sheets

Community workbooks hold things no save file does. `thetowersdk/sheets` reads and writes them, and
handles the parts that mislead:

```ts
import { TowerSheets } from 'thetowersdk/sheets'

const sheets = new TowerSheets({ transport, spreadsheetId, protectSpreadsheets: [COMMUNITY] })
const grid = await sheets.readGrid('Costs!A1:C50')     // padded to the shape you asked for
const formulas = await sheets.readFormulas('Derived!A1:A200')
if (formulas.likelySpilled) { /* only the anchor carries a formula */ }
```

Two reads look like data and are not. A **spilled** cell has no formula of its own, so a formula
read of an `ARRAYFORMULA` range comes back empty and reads as "plain typed values" — the opposite of
the truth. And the API **truncates** trailing empties, so a blank cell and an absent column arrive as
the same `undefined`. Both are reported rather than smoothed over.

Writes to a spreadsheet you name as protected throw rather than skipping, because a silent refusal
has your tool report success while the sheet never changed.

There is no `googleapis` dependency: the package describes the two calls it needs and you supply
them, which keeps it browser-safe and leaves your auth library your choice.
[`templates/sheets-client.ts`](templates/sheets-client.ts) is the adapter, and
[`docs/GOOGLE_SHEETS.md`](docs/GOOGLE_SHEETS.md) walks through registering a service account and
sharing a sheet with it.

---

## Optional Add-ons

Two packages sit alongside this one. Neither is a dependency and neither is bundled — install one
when you want what it does, and nothing here changes if you never do.

| Package | What it adds | Install |
|---|---|---|
| [`towerai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/towerai) | A knowledge base and an answering layer over this SDK's data | `npm install towerai` |
| [`adb-bridge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adb-bridge) | Pulls a save off an Android device to a local page | `npx adb-bridge` |

**TowerAI** answers questions; this package supplies the numbers it answers with. Build a knowledge
base by deriving prose from the catalogs rather than typing it, so a game update moves the corpus
instead of silently invalidating it:

```ts
import { buildTrackerAiCanonicalKbChunks, validateCanonicalKbArray } from 'towerai/kb'
import { LAB_CATALOG } from 'thetowersdk/data'

const mine = LAB_CATALOG.map(lab => ({
  chunk_id: `mine_lab_${lab.name}`,
  disambiguation: 'How many levels this lab has — not what order to research it in.',
  content: `The ${lab.name} lab has ${lab.levels?.length ?? 0} levels.`,
  // …
}))

validateCanonicalKbArray([...buildTrackerAiCanonicalKbChunks(), ...mine])
```

**adb-bridge** hands you save bytes over a WebSocket on `127.0.0.1:43781`; this package reads them.
Gate on the bridge's reported **protocol**, never its release number — the package was renamed and
restarted at `0.x`, so a version comparison reports a working bridge as too old.

[`docs/OPTIONAL_ADD_ONS.md`](docs/OPTIONAL_ADD_ONS.md) covers both in full.

---

## Desktop and Mobile

The SDK is plain TypeScript with no runtime dependencies and no DOM assumptions, so it runs unchanged
in an Electron renderer, an Electron main process, and a Capacitor WebView. `thetowersdk/node` is the
**only** entry point that needs Node — which is the boundary you want, since the decoder belongs on
the side that is allowed to read files.

Pin the toolchain first, with the hash corepack verifies against:

```json
{ "packageManager": "pnpm@10.8.1+sha512.c50088ba…", "engines": { "node": ">=22 <23" } }
```

[`docs/DESKTOP_AND_MOBILE.md`](docs/DESKTOP_AND_MOBILE.md) covers the main/renderer split, the IPC
boundary, running the bridge in-process, and what does and does not work on mobile.

---

## Patch Notes

Five years of the developers' own announcements, queryable. The catalogs say what a number **is**
today; this says **when it became that**, and what was said about it at the time.

```ts
import {
  whenIntroduced,
  searchPatchNotes,
  patchNotesForVersion,
  patchNotesBetween,
  recentPatchNotes,
  PATCH_NOTES_SOURCE,
} from 'thetowersdk/knowledge'

whenIntroduced('shockwave')
// { postedAt: '2021-07-15…', version: '0.1.29', title: 'v0.1.29 is out for everyone now…' }

searchPatchNotes('guardian')          // every note mentioning it, newest first
patchNotesForVersion('26.1.2')        // or 'v26.1.2' — both work
patchNotesBetween('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')
recentPatchNotes(5)                   // what changed lately

PATCH_NOTES_SOURCE
// { notes: 232, withVersion: 177, earliest: '2021-07-15…', latest: '2026-08-25…', … }
```

Every note carries the message id it came from, so a claim is traceable to the post rather than
to this package.

### What it will not tell you

**The archive begins on 2021-07-15**, the oldest post in the channel. `whenIntroduced` returning
`null` means *not in this archive*, not *this never existed*.

**A note mentioning a mechanic is not evidence the mechanic changed.** `searchPatchNotes` is a
text search over announcements: it finds leads, and the note still has to be read.

**`version` is `null` on 55 of the 232 notes**, because those notes state no version. It is not
inferred from the notes around it — a wrong version attached to a real change reads as fact.

### Keeping it current

```bash
npm run patch-notes:ingest   # read-only, resumable; needs a bot in the server
npm run patch-notes:build    # regenerate the shipped dataset
```

Both refuse rather than write something wrong. The ingest stops if the messages come back empty —
most notes are *forwarded*, and a forward carries its text in `message_snapshots`, not in
`content`. The build stops if more than half the notes land on one day, which is what dating by
the forward instead of the original looks like, and it stops if a version falls outside the range
the game has ever used.

`thetowersdk/knowledge` also carries a `patch-notes` compartment describing those traps, so an
agent asking *when did this change* meets the dating rule before it reaches a date.

---

## Using Your Own Artwork

This package ships **no images and no catalogue of them**. The art belongs to TechTree Games,
there is no permission to redistribute it, and a list naming every sprite in the game is derived
from the game whoever typed it — so that is not shipped either.

What ships is the naming rule, so a tool can find a file in a directory of artwork **you supply**.

```ts
import { gameAssetPath, gameAssetPaths, towerAssetUrl, assetSlug } from 'thetowersdk/assets'

gameAssetPath('Amplifying Strike', { domain: 'modules' })
// 'modules/amplifying-strike-md.webp'

gameAssetPaths('Om Chip', { domain: 'modules' })
// { sm: 'modules/om-chip-sm.webp', md: '…-md.webp', lg: '…-lg.webp' }

towerAssetUrl(gameAssetPath('Om Chip', { domain: 'modules' }), '/art')
// '/art/modules/om-chip-md.webp'
```

### Where to put the files

```
<your art root>/
  modules/amplifying-strike-sm.webp
  modules/amplifying-strike-md.webp
  modules/amplifying-strike-lg.webp
  cards/…   relics/…   enemies/…   guardians/…   perks/…
```

One directory per domain, one file per size, named `<slug>-<size>.<ext>`. The slug is the name
lowercased with runs of non-alphanumerics collapsed to a single hyphen — `Om Chip` becomes
`om-chip`, `Damage / Meter` becomes `damage-meter`. `assetSlug()` applies exactly that rule, so
name your files with it rather than reimplementing it: two implementations of one convention is
how a name stops matching its file.

`ASSET_DOMAINS` lists the directory names, `ASSET_SIZES` the sizes. Use whichever subset you have
— nothing requires all three sizes, and `extension` overrides `webp` if your files are `png`.

### It builds paths, it does not check them

These functions never touch the disk, because the disk is yours. A path pointing at a file you do
not have renders as a gap rather than throwing, so verify your own directory once at startup
instead of trusting a returned string. `null` comes back only when a name slugifies to nothing,
which stops `modules/-md.webp` from ever looking like a real path.

---

## Effective Paths

[Effective Paths][ep] is the community spreadsheet that works out the cheapest order to buy things
in — which lab, workshop stat or module to put your next coins into for the most effect. Its authors
take the numbers from the developers, which is why the SDK already checks its own tables against it:
see [`fixtures/data/README.md`](fixtures/data/README.md).

The solver is ported. Four models, each with the sheet's own paths:

| Model | Planner | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| eHP | `planEffectiveHealthPath` | `lab-time` · `lab-coins` · `stone` · `coin` |
| eRegen | `planEffectiveRegenPath` | `lab-time` · `lab-coins` |
| eDamage | `planEffectiveDamagePath` | `lab-time` · `lab-coins` · `stone` · `coin` · `keys` |
| eEcon | `planEffectiveEconomyPath` | `time` · `coin` · `stone` |
| eEcon Discount | `planEffectiveEconomyDiscountPath` | its own, ranking coins **saved** |

The lab path appears twice everywhere because the sheet prices the same candidates two ways — in
research days or in coins — and which one binds depends on the player.

```ts
import {
  planEffectiveDamagePath,
  ZERO_EFFECTIVE_DAMAGE_LEVELS,
  zeroEffectiveDamageConfig,
} from 'thetowersdk/mechanics'

const plan = planEffectiveDamagePath({
  config: zeroEffectiveDamageConfig(),   // the account: what is unlocked, owned, equipped
  levels: ZERO_EFFECTIVE_DAMAGE_LEVELS,  // what is bought, per candidate
  variant: 'lab-time',
  steps: 25,
})

plan.steps      // what to buy, in order, with cost, gain and ROI
plan.excluded   // what it did not offer, and why
plan.issues     // why it could not plan at all — empty on every plan that ran
```

### Planning For a Real Player

A plan takes two things, and they are different:

- a **config** — the account around the numbers: which weapons are unlocked, which cards are owned,
  what the modules are, which perks are taken;
- **levels** — how far each candidate is already bought.

**The SDK does not build either from a save.** It supplies the model and the zero records; mapping a
player onto them is yours to write, because where a player's data comes from — a save file, your own
database, a form — is your decision, not this package's.

The candidate lists are what make that mapping short. Each entry carries the `id` a plan reports
back, the `band` and `key` its level lives under, and the `sheetName` the community sheet uses:

```ts
import {
  EFFECTIVE_ECONOMY_UPGRADES,
  ZERO_EFFECTIVE_ECONOMY_LEVELS,
  planEffectiveEconomyPath,
  zeroEffectiveEconomyConfig,
} from 'thetowersdk/mechanics'

// However you got it — a save, a tracker, a form.
const myLabLevels = { 'Coins / Kill Bonus': 40, 'Golden Tower Bonus': 12 }

// Start from a complete zero record and fill it in. Do not build one by hand:
// a missing key reads as `undefined`, which becomes a NaN the planner refuses.
const levels = structuredClone(ZERO_EFFECTIVE_ECONOMY_LEVELS)
for (const candidate of EFFECTIVE_ECONOMY_UPGRADES) {
  const known = myLabLevels[candidate.sheetName]
  if (known !== undefined) levels[candidate.band][candidate.key] = known
}

const plan = planEffectiveEconomyPath({
  config: zeroEffectiveEconomyConfig(),
  levels,
  variant: 'time',
  steps: 5,
})

plan.steps    // → Coins / Kill Bonus L41, L42, L43 … — it continues from 40
plan.excluded // → Golden Tower Bonus — "the weapon is not unlocked"
```

That exclusion is the config talking, not the levels: a zero config owns no weapons, so the whole
Golden Tower band is out. Fill the config in the same way — start from `zeroEffectiveEconomyConfig()`
and set what you know — and those candidates appear.

Reading a save is a separate step, and the extractors are in
[`thetowersdk/save`](#reading-a-save): `readLabsFromSaveRoot`, `readWorkshopFromSaveRoot`,
`readModulesFromSaveRoot` and the rest give you the numbers to map from.

### An Empty Plan Always Says Why

The four families — damage, eHP, economy and regen — check their levels before planning and refuse
rather than compute against a record they cannot use. When that happens `steps` is empty and
`issues` names the offending key and what was wrong with it: a `NaN`, a missing entry, a level
stored as text.

```ts
if (plan.issues.length > 0) {
  // Not "this player has nothing worth buying" — "these levels are unusable".
  console.error(plan.issues) // [{ path: 'time.coinsKillBonus', message: '…' }]
}
```

A `NaN` level makes every gain `NaN`; every candidate then compares false against every other and
the greedy loop returns an empty path, which is indistinguishable from a fully-upgraded account.
Levels are validated once per plan rather than inside the evaluation loop, which runs many times
over inputs that do not change.

Levels are held to **completeness and finiteness, not magnitude**. Negative and fractional levels
are accepted, because the source model contains them.

### `excluded` is half the answer

Every planner reports the candidates it passed over, each with a reason: `already at its cap of 99`,
`the weapon is not unlocked`, `priced at 0 for level 12, which is not a cost`. **A candidate is
planned, or it is explained — never neither.**

A path that stops after one step usually means every other candidate is at its cap. Read`excluded` before treating a short path as an error.

Passing a variant a planner does not publish throws, naming the ones it does. Note that `lab` is a
damage *band* while `lab-time` is a *variant*.

### Discount Is a Different Quantity

`planEffectiveEconomyDiscountPath` ranks coins **saved**, not coins earned, so it is not comparable
to the others and has its own entry point. `planEffectiveEconomyPath` refuses `discount` and says so
rather than returning a table of zeroes.

### Checking It Against The Sheet

The port cites the cell behind every rule it implements — `eEcon!E6`, `eDamage Coins!EZ2` — and those
citations are enumerated by a test that checks the tab exists. If you are changing a formula, read
the cell first. `docs/EFFECTIVE_PATHS_ORACLE.md` in the tracker repo describes how, and which of the
spreadsheet API's answers are misleading: a spilled range reads as *empty* while `COUNTA` sees a
hundred rows of it.

The MCP server's `plan_effective_path` tool runs any of this without a scratch script — see
[`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md).

[`docs/EFFECTIVE_PATHS.md`](docs/EFFECTIVE_PATHS.md) is the longer version: how a config differs from
levels, why the damage and economy levels are banded, and what a step guarantees.

### Reading a Player's IDS Master

Most Effective Paths users keep an **IDS Master** behind their workbook — one `_IDS` tab that is
nothing but inputs: their labs, workshop, cards, bots, guardians, weapons, modules and vault. It is
the same account data a save carries, in a form a player maintains by hand.

The readers turn that block into typed rows:

```ts
import { readIdsLabs, readIdsWorkshop, readIdsCards } from 'thetowersdk/save'

const labs = readIdsLabs(grid)          // grid: the `_IDS` range as rows of cells
labs.rows                               // [{ name, level, target, max, saveIndex }, …]
labs.unmatchedNames                     // names the catalog does not know
labs.warnings                           // cells that would not read as levels
```

Every reader returns the same shape — `rows`, `unmatchedNames`, `warnings`. Blocks are located by
their heading rather than by column, so a reader works across IDS versions that lay the `_IDS` tab
out differently. A row's `saveIndex` is its position in the matching save array, so rows join to
save data by index rather than by name.

**These give you rows, not a player.** As with the planners above, mapping them onto your own
stores, database or forms is yours to write.

**A level is a plain number or a plain digit string.** Anything else — `"6,000"`, `"1e3"`, `"0x10"`,
a negative, an empty cell — reads as `null`, meaning the cell says nothing about that level. Names
are matched case- and spacing-insensitively, and a name the catalog does not know is reported in
`unmatchedNames` rather than dropped.

## Accuracy

Data tables are exact values, keyed to a specific game version — see `V283_GAME_DATA_META`.

The formulas under `mechanics/` are **approximations**. They are fitted to observed in-game
behavior and are close but not exact, particularly at very high waves and tiers. Don't rely on
them for anything that needs to match the game to the last digit.

Wave scaling in particular builds on earlier community work — see [Credits](#credits).

## Versioning

Below 1.0 the version is a build marker, not a compatibility promise: any release may rename or
remove an export, and data values may change with the game. Pin an exact version.

From 1.0:

- **Patch** — fixes, new extractors, additive data.
- **Minor** — data updated for a new game version; existing values may change.
- **Major** — breaking API changes.

Anything under `thetowersdk/internal/*` is not part of the public API and can change in any release.

## Where the Docs Live

| Surface | What it is | Edit it? |
|---|---|---|
| [thetowersdk website](https://tmrxjd.github.io/TheTowerSDK/) | Browsable docs, live demos, runnable examples | Generated |
| This repo | The source of truth: this README, [`docs/`](docs), [`examples/`](examples), [`templates/`](templates) | **Yes** |
| [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/TmRxJD/TheTowerSDK/wiki) | The same content, page-per-section, for reading on GitHub | **No — generated** |

Three surfaces, one source. Everything downstream is rendered from the files in this repository by
one command, so there is nothing to remember to update:

```bash
npm run docs:seed    # regenerate the wiki pages and the shared code snippets
npm run docs:check   # fail if any of them are stale (runs in `npm run verify`)
```

The wiki is rendered by [`scripts/build-wiki.mjs`](scripts/build-wiki.mjs). A GitHub wiki is a
separate repository that no pull request reviews, so hand-editing it would create a third docs
surface that silently drifts — every page carries a banner saying so, and an edit made there is
overwritten on the next push.

Code samples shared with the website come out of
[`scripts/build-doc-snippets.mjs`](scripts/build-doc-snippets.mjs), which extracts marked regions
from files that `npm run examples:run` **executes**. A hand-copied sample is correct on the day it
is pasted and silently wrong afterwards; an extracted one fails in CI before it can reach a page.

```ts
// >>> snippet: bot-in-one-line
const bot = createTowerBot({ commands: calculatorCommands() })
// <<< snippet
```

The link checker is strict on purpose: a relative link that escapes the package root resolves in the
authoring monorepo but 404s in the published repo, and it has found live ones.

### The Effective Paths team

Every `effectivePaths*` export in this package is a **port, not original work**. The maths is the
Effective Paths team's; this package only translates their
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YwZtKP6B4WYhRba5T6APJ1YxKNdfnIGQnprgnxmO7zc)
into TypeScript so other tools can reuse it. A large amount of the reference data here — the cost,
mastery and substat tables especially — was compiled with the help of that work.

- **Mattew** (`matteweon` on Discord) — IDS Master; the Effective Paths spreadsheets for The Tower.
- **QuietFanta** — eEcon Squirrel; the eHP Workshop+ sheet and the Workshop+ additions.
- **Bisse** — maintainer; also contributed the save-format reference this package's decoder is
  checked against.
- **Shiriru**, **Gladiator**, **Meringue** — maintainers and helpers.
- And everyone the sheet lists as a contributor — the full roster ships in code as
  `EFFECTIVE_PATHS_CONTRIBUTORS`, so a tool built on this can render the real list rather than a
  copy that drifts.

> **Support the Effective Paths team.** Enter creator code **`SHEETLORD`** at checkout in the
> [The Tower webstore](https://store.techtreegames.com/thetower/). It costs you nothing extra and
> supports the people who actually derived these formulas. If you ship anything built on the
> `effectivePaths*` exports, please pass this along — `EFFECTIVE_PATHS_ATTRIBUTION_WITH_SUPPORT`
> is a ready-made line for a footer or about box.

```ts
import {
  EFFECTIVE_PATHS_ATTRIBUTION_WITH_SUPPORT,
  EFFECTIVE_PATHS_AUTHORS,
  EFFECTIVE_PATHS_CONTRIBUTORS,
  EFFECTIVE_PATHS_MAINTAINERS,
  EFFECTIVE_PATHS_SUPPORT,
} from 'thetowersdk/mechanics'

console.log(EFFECTIVE_PATHS_ATTRIBUTION_WITH_SUPPORT)
console.log(EFFECTIVE_PATHS_SUPPORT.creatorCode) // 'SHEETLORD'
```

### The wiki contributors

The `thetowersdk/wiki` helpers fetch and reformat pages that other people wrote. Nothing there
produces knowledge of its own. Thank you to the volunteer editors of the
[Fandom — The Tower: Idle Tower Defense Wiki](https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/)
and [Game Vault — The Tower Wiki and Guides](https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.game-vault.net/wiki/).

Individual editors are deliberately not listed in code: wiki authorship changes continuously and is
recorded per page in each wiki's own history, so a snapshot would be wrong within a week and would
silently drop people. `fetchWikiPage()` returns the source `url` so you can link back to the page and
its edit history. `WIKI_ATTRIBUTION` is a ready-made credit line.

### Wave scaling

The wave scaling code builds on
[**tower-idle-toolkit**](https://github.com/tower-idle-toolkit/tower-idle-toolkit) by **skye**,
used under ISC. That project worked out the structure this scaler still uses, and several of its
constants come from there directly. It's no longer maintained, which is part of why this exists —
but the groundwork is theirs. See [NOTICE](NOTICE).
