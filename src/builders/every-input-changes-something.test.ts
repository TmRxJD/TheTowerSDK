/**
 * Every declared input has to be able to change the answer.
 *
 * This is the defect this codebase produces more than any other: a control the model supports,
 * that the wiring never passes, that nothing reports. It does not look like a bug — the page
 * renders, the number is plausible, and the only symptom is that moving a slider does nothing.
 *
 * The builders declare their own fields, so a field nothing reads is worse here than in a page:
 * every form, bot command and generated UI built on this package draws that control.
 *
 * Two traps in writing this check, both hit on the way:
 *
 * - Moving one field at a time reports fourteen false positives. Most of the damage-reduction
 *   inputs are gated: `chronoReductionPercent` does nothing until `useChronoField` is on, and
 *   `useChronoField` does nothing while the percentage is zero. Neither is dead; each is half of
 *   a pair, and a probe that moves one at a time cannot see that.
 * - A field can matter without changing the SHAPE of the result, so the comparison has to be over
 *   the whole value rather than a summary of it.
