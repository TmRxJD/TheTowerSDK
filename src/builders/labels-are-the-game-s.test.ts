/**
 * Every control a player sees is named the way the game and the community name it.
 *
 * The builders declare their own fields, so whatever is written here is what a form, a bot
 * command and the documentation site all render. That made a private naming habit public: fields
 * were labelled `Cost curve` with options reading `WSP_SUPER_CRIT_MULTI`, and one calculator
 * asked for an "Enemy factor" and a "Module benefit" — the parameters of a formula, not anything
 * a player can read off their screen.
 *
 * None of it failed a test. Each calculator computed the right number and rendered perfectly,
 * and the only symptom was that nobody could tell what to type into it.
