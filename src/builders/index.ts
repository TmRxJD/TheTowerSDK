/**
 * Calculator builders — the plumbing, so what is left is the UI.
 *
 * Each builder pairs the maths in `thetowersdk/mechanics` with the things a tool needs
 * around it and never gets for free: a complete set of defaults, a description of every
 * input, normalisation of whatever half-filled state a form is in, and a result that says
 * what it could not work out.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { labResearchCalculator } from 'thetowersdk/builders'
 *
 * const result = labResearchCalculator.compute({ labName: 'Damage', targetLevel: 10 })
 * console.log(result.totalCoinCost, result.totalHours)
 * for (const note of result.notes) console.warn(note)
 * ```
 *
 * Render a form without knowing the calculator:
 *
 * ```ts
 * for (const field of labResearchCalculator.fields) {
 *   // 'number' | 'select' | 'boolean' | 'number-list'; field.options is present for selects
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Every builder is pure and browser-safe: no I/O, no clock, no DOM. The same call in a
 * worker, in Node and in a page gives the same answer.
 *
 * These wrap the mechanics rather than reimplementing them, so a correction to a formula
 * reaches every tool built on this without anyone re-deriving it.
