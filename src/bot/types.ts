/**
 * The shape of a bot command, independent of any bot library.
 *
 * Nothing here imports discord.js, and nothing here knows what a Discord interaction is.
 * A command is a name, a list of declared options, and a function from parsed arguments to
 * a reply — which means the same command runs in a test, on a CLI, and behind whatever
 * gateway library you happen to be using, and only a thin adapter changes.
 *
 * That separation is the performance story as much as the portability one: a command that
 * cannot touch the gateway cannot accidentally await it, and the whole registry can be
 * exercised at full speed in a unit test.
