/**
 * How much of the data surface has a declared schema, said out loud.
 *
 * `DATA_TABLE_SCHEMAS` described itself as "every public data export", and its test as validating
 * "every public data table". Both hold eleven entries. There are 138 exported tables.
 *
 * The count is not the problem — writing a schema means reading a table and stating its real
 * shape, and a guessed one is worse than none because it passes. The problem was the word "every",
 * which stops a reader asking whether their table is covered. Someone adding a catalog reads that
 * sentence and concludes the validation already includes them.
 *
 * So this measures instead of claiming. Two directions, both able to fail:
 *
 * - The floor moves one way. If coverage drops, a schema was deleted and something is now
 *   unvalidated that used to be checked.
 * - Every declared schema must name a table that exists, or the registry is describing exports
 *   that are gone — the same drift, in the other direction.
 *
 * There is deliberately no upper bound. Filling the gap in is welcome and must never fail a build.
