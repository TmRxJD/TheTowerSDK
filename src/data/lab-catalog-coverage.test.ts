 * Paths reference, and they split evenly between the two failure modes:
 *
 * - Mispointed, data already present. berserker_mastery and
 *   recovery_package_mastery are filed as "Berzerker Mastery" and "Recovery
 *   Package Chance Mastery"; both now have aliases.
 * - Genuinely missing, now acquired. The three enemy Health labs share the
 *   Attack cost/time table exactly, and wave_skip_mastery shares the card
 *   mastery table (its effect value is still unknown -- see labs-catalog).
 *
 * The six that remain are all absent from the reference too, and the game dump
 * has only placeholder defaults for them (levelMax 99, baseCoinCost 30,
 * baseTime 15 -- identical across all six, and contradicting the research
 * catalog's own 50/50/50/50/1/1). They need a fresh extraction, not a lookup.
