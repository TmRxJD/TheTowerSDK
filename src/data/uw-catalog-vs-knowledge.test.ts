/**
 * The stone catalog and the knowledge compartments describe the same nine weapons from two
 * different sources — the catalog from game data, the compartments from the wiki. Nothing
 * joined them, and a scratch script (`probe-uw.ts`) was the only thing that had ever
 * compared them. That is how the catalog once named the wrong upgrade for eight of the nine
 * weapons: every weapon still had four plausible stat names, so it read as correct.
 *
 * The two disagree on base-stat wording on purpose — the wiki says "Bonus" and "Speed
 * Reduction" where the catalog says "Multiplier" and "Speed" — so this does NOT assert the
 * base names match. It asserts the part that is unambiguous: the catalog carries the three
 * base stats plus exactly one more, and that extra one is the weapon's UW+ ability.
