/**
 * Game names that reach a person must exist in a catalog.
 *
 * This repo's own rule is "never write a game name from memory", and the reason is that a
 * wrong one does not fail — it renders. Two shipped in code written for this package:
 * a builder labelled `Defence Absolute` where the game says `Defense Absolute`, and a module
 * called `Omni Amplifier`, which is not a thing (OA is Orbital Augment). Neither was caught
 * by a compiler, a linter, a reviewer or a spellchecker; `Defence` is correct English.
 *
 * ## What is checked, and what is not
 *
 * **Text a person sees**: builder field labels and help, and the prose in `docs/`, the
 * README, examples and templates. Those are where a name is an assertion about the game.
 *
 * Not every comment in `src`. An earlier version of this swept everything and produced 833
 * candidates — mostly ordinary English in quotes. A check nobody can read is a check nobody
 * runs, and the noise would have buried the two real ones.
