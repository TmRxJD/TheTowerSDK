/**
 * Module merging — what each step consumes, and what it produces.
 *
 * ## Fodder is whole modules
 *
 * There is no separate "merge material" currency. Every merge consumes complete
 * modules, and everything they carry — level, sub-effects — is destroyed with
 * them. Only the base module survives, keeping its level and sub-effects.
 *
 * ## Two ways a fodder module can qualify
 *
 * `template` means the SAME module, by name. `type` means ANY module of the
 * same type (Cannon, Armor, Generator, Core). They are not interchangeable, and
 * a cost model that treats all fodder as fungible understates every
 * `template` step — those need a specific module, not just a slot filler.
 *
 * ## `uniqueOnly`, and why a Rare stops at Legendary +
 *
 * From `Legendary + → Mythic` upward, every step requires unique lineage — a
 * module descended from a natural (drawn) Epic. A module whose line began as a
 * Rare satisfies every rule below that point and none above it, which is
 * exactly why the wiki says a Rare can be merged to Legendary + and no further.
 * Two independent sources agreeing on the same ceiling.
 *
 * ## Source
 *
 * Transcribed from `packages/bemerged/src/engine/GameEngine.ts`
 * (`MERGE_OUTCOME_RULES`) on 2026-08-17 — the merge simulator's own rule table,
 * which reproduces the in-game merge chart. Cross-checked against the wiki's
 * Merging Modules section, which agrees on the three starting-rarity ceilings
 * and on stars being Ancestral-only.
 *
 * bemerged keeps its own copy because it is a separate product in-tree. If the
 * two ever disagree, they are describing the same game and one is wrong.

/**
 * The community guide's merge table, which does NOT reconcile with the above.
 *
 * Recorded verbatim rather than adapted, because the disagreement is the useful
 * part and adapting it would hide which source said what.
 *
 * The guide splits cost into "duplicates" and "rares", which maps naturally onto
 * this file's `template` and `type` match modes — a promising sign that the two
 * are describing the same structure. But the numbers do not line up under any
 * reading I could make work:
 *
 * - "Legendary -> Legendary +: 2 duplicates" agrees exactly with the recipe,
 *   whose fodder is one `Epic +` and therefore two copies of the same module.
 * - "Legendary + -> Mythic: 4 duplicates + 36 rares" does not. The recipe wants
 *   one `Legendary +`, which is eight drawn epics, not four of anything.
 *
 * So one row matches and the next does not, which rules out a simple unit
 * mismatch and rules out a row shift. Either the guide is summarising a
 * different progression path — buying rather than merging some steps, say — or
 * one of the two is wrong. A third source is needed and there isn't one: the
 * wiki's Merging Modules section agrees with the recipes on the three ceilings
 * and says nothing about totals.
 *
 * Do NOT reconcile these by adjusting either side to fit. The recipes are
 * exercised by a working merge simulator; the guide is a trusted document; and
 * a number invented to bridge them would be worse than the gap.
