/**
 * Every relic's `bonusType` against the description the GAME ships for it.
 *
 * ## The axis the other relic tests do not cover
 *
 * `relics-vs-catalog.test.ts` checks each relic's VALUE against its description,
 * and `relic-game-truth.test.ts` checks that each `benefitType` resolves to one
 * `bonusType`. Both pass while a relic sits under the wrong STAT, because a
 * consistently wrong mapping is still consistent — and consistency is all those
 * tests can see.
 *
 * That gap is not hypothetical. The generator once used a hand-authored
 * `benefitType -> stat` table with a `?? 'Damage'` fallback, and every
 * benefitType the table missed became a Damage relic silently. Eight relics were
 * wrong that way, including every Free Attack Upgrade one. Nothing here caught
 * it; it surfaced as an Effective Paths residual, and the first conclusion drawn
 * was that the community sheet must be over-counting. It was not.
 *
 * ## Why a majority vote rather than a table
 *
 * The expected stat for each phrase is learned from the catalog by majority. A
 * hand-written phrase->stat table is precisely what caused the original bug, so
 * writing another one here would reproduce the failure inside its own guard. If
 * twenty relics reading "increase tower damage" are typed Damage and one reading
 * "increase free attack upgrade" is ALSO typed Damage, the majority establishes
 * the honest mapping and the odd one out is the defect.
