/**
 * Read a player's IDS Master block and turn it into a save-shaped object.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The Effective Paths port has a second job: ONBOARDING. A player who keeps an
 * EP copy maintains an IDS Master behind it, and the IDS is nothing but inputs
 * -- that is the entire point of the IDS system, so the arithmetic sheet can be
 * updated underneath without the player retyping their levels. Which means that
 * however OLD somebody's EP sheet is, the IDS behind it can still fill their
 * site trackers.
 *
 * ## Why it emits a save root rather than writing anything
 *
 * The site already has one import path, and it is not this file's business to
 * add a second. `readLabsFromSaveRoot` and its siblings consume a decoded save
 * root; the import composables consume those readers; and
 * `finishTrackerImportPersistence` is the single durable write. So the cheapest
 * correct adapter is the one that stops here, at a `parsedRoot`-shaped object,
 * and lets every existing layer do its own job unchanged.
 *
 * ## Why the join is by NAME and never by index
 *
 * The captured community sheets span v5.07 to v5.09, and the v5.07 block is
 * 219 rows where the current one is 223. An old IDS is a PREFIX of the current
 * catalog, so a positional join would silently shift every lab after the first
 * inserted row -- levels that look plausible and are all wrong. Names are
 * stable across those releases; positions are not.

/**
 * Where the IDS spells a lab differently from the catalog.
 *
 * Every entry was resolved by ELIMINATION rather than by picking the nearest
 * string. Across the nine captured sheets, 209 of 220 names resolve directly;
 * the catalog indices that no sheet ever claims are then listed, and each
 * unresolved name has exactly ONE free named slot left. That is why
 * `Swamp Rend` is safe: the catalog carries both `Swamp Rend - Basic Enemies`
 * and `Swamp Rend - Additional Enemies`, the sheets already claim the second by
 * its full name, and only the first is unclaimed. Nearest-string alone would
 * have had to toss a coin.
 *
 * `Common Enemy` is a RENAME, not a variant: v5.09.03 sheets say `Basic Enemy`
 * and every older release says `Common Enemy`, and no sheet has both. Both
 * spellings therefore map to the same index and neither is dropped.
 *
 * `ids-import.test.ts` asserts that no captured sheet has an unmatched name, so
 * a future release that renames another lab fails there by name instead of
 * quietly importing that lab at level zero.
