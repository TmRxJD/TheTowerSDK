/**
 * Perk index -> name, pinned to what the game does with each index.
 *
 * Thirteen of the thirty-four names in `PERK_IMPORT_CATALOG` were wrong. The
 * ultimate-weapon block was entirely correct, the trade-off block had two
 * transposed pairs, and the standard block had eleven of fifteen misplaced. The
 * names had been written in display order rather than index order, so runs of
 * them were shifted.
 *
 * Nothing caught it, and one test actively encoded it: `perks.test.ts` asserted
 * that the save's `firstPerkIndex` of 10 was "Free Upgrade Chance for All",
 * which is what the catalog said and not what the game does with index 10.
 *
 * ## What identifies a perk
 *
 * Not its name — that is the thing that drifted. `PerkBenefitUp(i)` and
 * `PerkBenefitDown(i)` are called from a specific function and their result is
 * written to a specific field, and THAT is the fingerprint:
 *
 *     3  -> Main.coinsBonusUpgrade and Main.coinsPerWave   (both: "All Coin Bonuses")
 *     8  -> free{Attack,Defense,Utility}UpgradeChance      (all three, additive)
 *     10 -> Perks.ApplyWaveBenefit                         (the wave requirement)
 *     4  -> Main.bounceTargets, integer add                (Bounce Shot +2)
 *     7  -> Main.orbCount, integer add                     (Orbs +1)
 *
 * Two indices call neither function: 11 unlocks a weapon and 23 adds a set of
 * mines. Neither has a scalar benefit, which is itself identifying.
