/**
 * A `fetch`-shaped transport backed by curl, for wikis that refuse Node.
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist
 *
 * Game Vault's edge rejects Node's HTTP client. Not its headers — its client.
 * curl and `fetch` were run against the same URL, from the same machine and IP,
 * within the same minute, with identical User-Agent and Accept: curl returned
 * 200 every time and `fetch` returned 403 with an HTML error page every time,
 * across six trials of five different header combinations. Nothing that can be
 * put in a request changes it, so the only fix is a different client.
 *
 * This is deliberately narrow. It is not a general HTTP layer and should not
 * grow into one: it exists so `searchWikis` can consult a wiki that the platform
 * fetch cannot reach, and it implements exactly the slice of the `fetch`
 * interface that `wiki-sources.ts` uses — GET, headers in, `ok` / `status` /
 * `json()` / `text()` out.
 *
 * Node only, and it spawns a process per request. Cache aggressively.
 */

/**
 * `node:child_process` is loaded ON FIRST USE, never at module scope.
 *
 * This file is Node-only, but it is exported from `wiki/index.ts`, so it reaches a
 * browser bundle whether or not anything in the browser calls it. A top-level
 * `import ... from 'node:child_process'` is EVALUATED on import, and bundlers
 * externalise it with a throwing stub -- so merely loading the barrel throws
 * `Module "node:child_process" has been externalized for browser compatibility`
 * and the whole application fails to mount.
 *
 * A dynamic import inside the function is not evaluated until something calls
 * it, which in a browser is never. Node behaviour is unchanged.
