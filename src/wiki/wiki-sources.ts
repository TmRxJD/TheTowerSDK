/**
 * The Tower's community wikis, as a set rather than a single site.
 *
 * ## Why more than one
 *
 * There are two active wikis and they do not carry the same pages. Game Vault
 * is a fork of the Fandom wiki and has since diverged: several stats whose
 * Fandom page is an empty stub — Bounce Shot, Multishot, Rend Armor — have a
 * full table on Game Vault. The oracle already cited Game Vault by hand for
 * exactly those three, with a note saying Fandom was empty, which is the sign
 * that one source was never enough.
 *
 * So a lookup that consults one wiki and reports "the wiki does not say" is
 * making a claim it has not checked. `searchWikis` and `fetchWikiPage` take the
 * set and report WHICH site answered, because provenance is the point: a claim
 * sourced to Game Vault and a claim sourced to Fandom are different claims even
 * when they agree.
 *
 * ## Their quirks are not the same
 *
 * Both are MediaWiki, so the wikitext converter works on either. Everything
 * else about them differs and is recorded per source below rather than assumed:
 * the API lives at a different path on each, and Game Vault's CirrusSearch
 * backend returns `cirrussearch-backend-error` for every `list=search` query,
 * so it has to be searched by prefix instead. Discovering that took one request;
 * assuming `list=search` works everywhere would have looked like "Game Vault has
 * no page about this".
 *
 * ## Licence
 *
 * Both wikis are CC-BY-SA and this package is MIT, so pages are fetched, never
 * bundled. They are volunteer-run — cache what you fetch and space out bulk
 * pulls.
