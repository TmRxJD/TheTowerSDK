/**
 * The artwork helpers build paths into a directory the CALLER supplies.
 *
 * This package ships no images and no catalogue of them. It used to ship a catalogue — 1,059
 * sprite names read out of the game — and that was withdrawn: a list naming every asset is
 * derived from the game whoever typed it, and there is no permission to redistribute the art or
 * anything that closely describes it.
 *
 * What is left is the naming rule, which is this project's own. These tests pin the rule, because
 * a caller laying out their own directory has to apply the same one — two implementations of a
 * convention is how a name stops matching its file.
