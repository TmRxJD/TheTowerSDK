/**
 * Working with The Tower's artwork — which this package does not ship.
 *
 * The images belong to TechTree Games. This project has no permission to redistribute them, and
 * a catalogue of their filenames is close enough to the same thing that it is not shipped either:
 * a list naming every sprite in the game is derived from the game, whoever typed it.
 *
 * What ships is the part that is genuinely ours: the **naming rule**, so a tool can find a file
 * in a directory of artwork you supply yourself. Point it at your own extraction, lay the files
 * out as described below, and every path resolves.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { gameAssetPath, towerAssetUrl } from 'thetowersdk/assets'
 *
 * gameAssetPath('Amplifying Strike', { domain: 'modules' })
 * // 'modules/amplifying-strike-md.webp'
 *
 * towerAssetUrl(gameAssetPath('Om Chip', { domain: 'modules' }), '/art')
 * // '/art/modules/om-chip-md.webp'
 * ```
 *
 * ## The layout
 *
 * ```
 * <your art root>/
 *   modules/amplifying-strike-sm.webp
 *   modules/amplifying-strike-md.webp
 *   modules/amplifying-strike-lg.webp
 *   cards/…  relics/…  enemies/…  guardians/…  perks/…
 * ```
 *
 * One directory per domain, one file per size, named `<slug>-<size>.<ext>`. The slug is the
 * entity's name lowercased with non-alphanumerics collapsed to single hyphens — `assetSlug()`
 * applies exactly that rule, so a caller never has to guess at it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here asserts a file exists
 *
 * These functions build a path; they do not check the disk, because the disk is yours. A path
 * that resolves to nothing renders as a gap rather than throwing, so verify your own directory
 * once at startup rather than trusting a returned string.
