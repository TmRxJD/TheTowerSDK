/**
 * The Tower's compartments — content, not substrate.
 *
 * Each compartment is a scoped knowledge space with its own maturity. Nothing
 * here is reusable in another repo; everything here is the point of this one.
 *
 * ## Adding a compartment
 *
 * Write `<name>.ts` beside its siblings, export nodes and edges, then register
 * it below with a `domain` written in the vocabulary a *player* would use — not
 * a developer. The domain string is what someone searches when they do not yet
 * know the entity ids.
