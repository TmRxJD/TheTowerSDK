/**
 * Footguns — permanence rules, and the community's advice about them.
 *
 * Read from the wiki's Footguns page on 2026-08-16. That page is real and
 * carefully written, and it sits in `Category:Guides`.
 *
 * ## Why this family is split down the middle
 *
 * The page mixes two kinds of claim, and they must not be stored the same way:
 *
 *  - **Objective.** UW picks and upgrades are permanent. Lab research cannot be
 *    turned off, Range excepted. Bot medal upgrades respec; bot cooldown labs
 *    do not. At max cooldown every bot except Flame, plus BH and DW, sits at
 *    50s while GT sits at 100s. These are verifiable and a tool may rely on them.
 *
 *  - **Sentiment.** Which UW to pick. Whether Multiverse Nexus is "a minor
 *    footgun". Whether Chrono Field Range is worth maxing — the page argues both
 *    sides and lands on yes. Whether to chase 3:20 natural sync. All of it is
 *    community judgement, phrased as such: *"you will thank yourself in the long
 *    run"*, *"the difference in CPH is minimal"*.
 *
 * An agent that flattens these will either hard-code an opinion into a
 * calculator, or throw away a permanence rule because it arrived wrapped in
 * advice. The `claimType` field keeps them apart, and the oracle's tools label
 * sentiment in their output.
 *
 * ## What this family is actually for
 *
 * Not upgrade recommendations — that is outside this oracle's job. It is here
 * because **reversibility is a modelling fact.** A tool that edits module
 * levels, bot cooldowns or UW stats needs to know which of those an account can
 * undo: a preview-and-revert affordance is required where an edit is permanent
 * and pointless where it is not.
