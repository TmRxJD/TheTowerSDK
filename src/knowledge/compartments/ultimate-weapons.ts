 *    through prose in other nodes, below the confidence floor.
 * 3. Added back once the UW+ labels were changed to lead with the weapon
 *    ("Chain Lightning - Smite (CL+)"), which makes the ability's label strictly
 *    longer than the weapon's. The compound query now prefers the ability and
 *    the bare name prefers the weapon, because the more specific entity finally
