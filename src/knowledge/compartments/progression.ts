/**
 * One edge per system a milestone gates, generated from the unlock table.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-17 the milestone node NAMED six gates in its assertions and had
 * no edge to any of them, so "what does a milestone unlock" was answerable and
 * "what gates modules" was not. A relation that exists in one direction only is
 * half a relation.
 *
 * Generated rather than written out, so a system cannot be gated in the table
 * and unreachable in the graph.
 *
 * Three systems are deliberately skipped:
 *
 * - `cardMastery`, `workshopEnhancement`, `tournament` — these already have
 *   hand-written edges in their own compartments, and those carry a COMPOUND
 *   condition this table does not know about: card mastery also needs 30 maxed
 *   cards, enhancements also need their own lab completed. A generated edge
 *   would duplicate them and state the weaker version of the rule.
 *
 * The general principle: generate to guarantee coverage, defer to a hand-written
 * edge wherever it says more than the table can.
