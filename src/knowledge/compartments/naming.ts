/**
 * Naming — what the game itself calls things.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own compartment
 *
 * Naming has produced more defects in this repo than any single mechanic, and
 * they share a shape: a lookup misses, returns a neutral default, and nothing
 * reports it. `Ancestral 5*` scoring 1 instead of 30. Enhancements keyed by
 * display name against a store keyed by code, returning 0 for months. Lab
 * identities splitting because one path stripped apostrophes and another did
 * not.
 *
 * None of those looked like bugs. They looked like small numbers.
 *
 * ## The authority
 *
 * The strings the game itself renders to a player. That is the closest thing to
 * a naming spec that exists — above the wiki, above our catalogs, below only
 * reading the screen.
 *
 * ## The caveat that matters
 *
 * The known set of game strings is **incomplete**, so a name being *absent*
 * from it proves nothing. Only a near-miss is evidence: the game naming the
 * same thing a different way. Several correct names do not appear in the known
 * set at all.

 * Wiring an acronym expander into a model did not stop it hallucinating

 * wrong mechanism: if the model produces the expansion, it can produce a wrong
 * one, and a plausible wrong expansion is indistinguishable from a right one
 * downstream.
 *
 * So the expansion is served from a closed set. `oracle_expand` returns every
 * known reading with its entity, and the instruction is explicit: choose from
 * this list, do not generate. Where more than one reading exists, all are
 * returned with guidance and the caller picks from context — or asks.
 *
 * Only genuinely confusable or ambiguous entries live here. Unambiguous
