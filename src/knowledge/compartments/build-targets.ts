/**
 * Build targets — the breakpoints players name and chase.
 *
 * ## What these are
 *
 * `PBHGT`, `DW3`, `CF75`, `SL4`, `floodlight`. Not game mechanics and not
 * stats: they are *thresholds* the community has named, each meaning "this
 * stat has reached a value that unlocks a way of playing".
 *
 * ## Why the graph needs them
 *
 * They dominate how players actually talk. A user asking "what do I need for
 * PBHGT?" is asking a precise question about cooldown and duration values, and
 * an agent that resolves it to a module — which is what happened before this
 * compartment existed — will build something unrelated with confident-looking
 * inputs.
 *
 * ## Why they are sentiment
 *
 * The game has no "perma" state, no `DW3` flag, no floodlight mode. Each is a
 * community convention describing a relationship between numbers. The
 * *relationship* is objective; that it is worth chasing is judgement, and the
 * exact threshold shifts with patches and playstyle. So: never hard-code one
 * as a constant or a mode.
