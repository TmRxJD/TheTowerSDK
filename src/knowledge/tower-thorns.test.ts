/**
 * The thorns breakpoints, checked as arithmetic rather than trusted as a list.
 *
 * Thorns deals a share of an enemy's MAX health, so damage per hit is constant
 * and hits-to-kill is a pure function of the percentage. That makes the guide's
 * list falsifiable without another source: each entry should be the SMALLEST
 * percentage that kills in one fewer hit than the one before it.
 *
 * ## The rule the list revealed
 *
 * Checking it exposed which comparison the game uses. Under `ceil(100 / p)` the
 * minimal thresholds would be 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 25, 34, 50 — and the guide
 * says 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 21, 26, 34, 51. The two differ at exactly the four
 * points where 100 / p divides evenly, and nowhere else.
 *
 * That is the signature of a STRICT comparison: the enemy dies when cumulative
 * thorns damage EXCEEDS its max health, not when it reaches it. At 50% two hits
 * deal exactly 100% and the enemy lives; at 51% two hits deal 102% and it does
 * not. So `hitsToKill = floor(100 / p) + 1`, and under that rule all nine of the
 * guide's entries are minimal.
 *
 * The same `>` versus `>=` distinction decides the enemy-level-skip counter, and
 * in both places it is worth exactly one step at the boundary.
 */

/*
 * The SHIPPED function, not a local copy of the formula.
 *
 * The first version of this file defined its own `hitsToKill` and checked the
 * breakpoint list against it. Every case passed — and passed just as happily
 * with `thornsHitsToKill` planted as `ceil(100 / p)`, because nothing here ever
 * called it. A test that reimplements the thing it is testing verifies the list
 * and nothing else.
