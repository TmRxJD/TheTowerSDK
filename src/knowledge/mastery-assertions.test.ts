/**
 * Masteries were the largest gap in the graph: 33 of 36 nodes carried no
 * assertion at all, so 31 per-card nodes described a system in prose that
 * nothing could contradict.
 *
 * The assertion that earns its keep is `resolvesToCatalogCard`. The other four
 * per-mastery claims restate a table ten lines away and can only fail if
 * someone edits that table; this one JOINS the mastery to the shipped card
 * catalog, and it is false the moment a card is renamed or dropped. That join
 * has silently broken twice — `Berserker` against a `Berzerker` typo, and
 * `Package Chance` against `Recovery Package Chance` — and both times it read
 * as "that card has no mastery" rather than as a mismatch.
