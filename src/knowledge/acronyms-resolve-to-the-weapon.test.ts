/**
 * An acronym resolves to the thing it names, not to something whose label spells it.
 *
 * `resolve('gt')` used to return `ultimateWeaponPlus.goldenCombo`, whose label is
 * "Golden Tower - Golden Combo (GT+)". The scoring matched `gt` as a SUBSTRING of the literal
 * "gt+", while "Golden Tower" — which contains no "gt" anywhere — scored nothing. So the wrong
 * node won, and `resolveWithConfidence` reported it as `strong`.
 *
 * `bh` reached Consume (the Black Hole *plus* upgrade) and `dw` reached Kill Wall the same way.
 * Three of the most common abbreviations in the game answered with an adjacent entity and gave
 * no reason to doubt it — which is worse than not resolving at all, because an agent asking the
 * oracle what GT means is asking precisely because it does not know.
 *
 * `GT` and `GT+` are different things here, so both must keep working and must not collide.
