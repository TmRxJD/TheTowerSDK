/**
 * Every export the oracle points at must exist.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `implementedBy` is the field that makes this graph useful for *building*
 * something rather than only for understanding it: it tells an agent "the SDK
 * already does this, call it". That is worth nothing — worse than nothing — if
 * the name is wrong.
 *
 * A hallucinated export is caught immediately by the compiler and costs a
 * minute. The failure this guards against is subtler and much more expensive:
 * an agent looks for `computeModuleStat`, does not find it under the name the
 * oracle gave, concludes the SDK has no such helper, and writes a fresh
 * implementation beside the correct one. Now there are two, they disagree at
 * the star tiers, and nothing reports it.
 *
 * So the oracle is not allowed to name an export it cannot produce.
