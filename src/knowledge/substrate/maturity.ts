/**
 * Compartment maturity — falsifiable metrics, not vibes.
 *
 * ## Why maturity belongs to compartments
 *
 * Agents are stateless between sessions. Knowledge persists. So the thing that
 * matures is the compartment, and a fresh agent reading a well-verified one
 * outperforms an experienced agent reading a thin one. Tracking "agent
 * experience" measures the wrong object and cannot be falsified.
 *
 * Every metric here can be computed and argued with. That is the entire point:
 * an agent should be able to calibrate its own confidence from
 * "82% primary-sourced, 3 stale claims, 1 unresolved contradiction" rather than
 * from a node count that says nothing about whether any of it is true.
 *
 * ## The counter-intuitive one
 *
 * **Low trap density means unexercised, not clean.** A compartment nobody has
 * been burned by is one nobody has used in anger. Traps only get written after
 * something goes wrong, so their absence is an absence of evidence.
