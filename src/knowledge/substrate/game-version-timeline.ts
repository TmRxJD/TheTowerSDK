/**
 * Which build of the game was live when a claim was read.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * A game-sourced claim carries `sourceVersion: 'v28.3.0-arm64'`, so when a new
 * dump lands you can tell at a glance which claims were checked against the old
 * one. A wiki claim carried only `verifiedAt`, a calendar date — and a calendar
 * date says nothing about whether the developers have rebalanced since.
 *
 * That asymmetry meant the weakest claims were the ones you could not age. The
 * fix is not to hand-stamp 219 wiki sources, which would be transcription and
 * would drift the moment anyone added a claim. It is to record WHEN EACH BUILD
 * WAS LIVE, once, and derive every stamp from the date already on the claim.
 *
 * ## Reading this honestly
 *
 * A stamp says "this was read while build X was live". It does NOT say the
 * claim was true of build X, and it does not say a wiki page had caught up to
 * build X — pages lag patches by months, and `fandom:Rapid Fire` was last
 * edited in 2024. It tells you one thing precisely: whether the game has been
 * rebuilt since anybody looked.
 *
 * `until: null` means the build is current. Add the next entry when a dump
 * lands, and every claim read before it is instantly identifiable as older than
 * the game — which is the whole point.
