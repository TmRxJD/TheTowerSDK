/**
 * ACS substrate — the repo-agnostic schema.
 *
 * ## What lives here versus next door
 *
 * **Substrate** (this folder): schema, query surface, maturity metrics,
 * contradiction detection. Nothing in it knows what The Tower is. It could be
 * lifted into any repo unchanged.
 *
 * **Content** (`../compartments/`): the actual claims about this game.
 *
 * That split is the point. A substrate entangled with its first content is a
 * bespoke system wearing a framework's name.
 *
 * ## The four fields every claim carries
 *
 * Each answers a different question, and collapsing any two of them loses
 * information that is expensive to recover later:
 *
 * | Field | Question |
 * |---|---|
 * | `claimType` | Is this a fact or an opinion? |
 * | `verification` | Do *we* trust it, here, in this repo? |
 * | `provenance` | Where did it come from, and against what version? |
 * | `assertions` | What does it say, in a form a machine can compare? |
 *
 * `claimType` and `verification` are deliberately orthogonal. An imported
 * claim may be objective or sentiment, and a shared pack full of another
 * repo's *opinions* is a very different risk from one full of their
 * *measurements*.
 */

/**
 * How much authority a source carries, independent of how recent it is.
 *

 * A published package should state what is true; the trail by which someone
 * became confident is working material and does not belong in a distributed
 * artefact.

 *
 * > "Tier 22 grants a substantial coin bonus, higher than tier 21."
 * > "Coin bonus at tier 22 sits just above 21's."
 *
 * These also disagree, and detecting it is a `GROUP BY`:
 *
 * ```
 * (tier.22, coinBonus) = 72   [in-game,  v28.3]
 * (tier.22, coinBonus) = 75   [code,     unknown]
 * ```
 *
 * That second shape is exactly the defect this repo shipped for months. So
 * every claim worth contradicting carries a triple alongside its prose: the
 * prose is for the reader, the triple is what Sentinel operates on.

   * the four curated entry points re-export:
   *
   *     thetowersdk/data        src/data/index.ts
   *     thetowersdk/mechanics   src/mechanics/index.ts

   * is not public, however exported it looks at its definition.
   *
   * So when the thing you want to name is a compartment-local constant, there
   * are exactly two correct moves and no third:
   *
   *   1. It is genuinely API a caller should reach for — add it to the relevant
   *      entry point's export list, deliberately, then name it here.
   *   2. It is data backing a claim rather than a tool — leave it out of this
   *      field and carry its VALUE in an `assertions` entry instead. That is
   *      what makes it checkable, which is what you actually wanted.
   *
   * `knowledge-exports.test.ts` enforces this. It has caught the same mistake
   * twice, both times because this comment used to say only "exports" and a
   * compartment constant is, after all, exported.
