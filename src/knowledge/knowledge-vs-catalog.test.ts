/**
 * The oracle checked against the catalogs.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * Writing the knowledge graph, I copied the wiki's tier coin-bonus table into
 * it. The catalog already held that table, from a different source, and the two
 * disagreed at tiers 22, 23 and 24 — a conflict created and shipped inside a
 * single sitting, invisible because both copies looked authoritative.
 *
 * That is the repo's signature defect wearing new clothes: *supported by the
 * model, never reconciled with the wiring, nothing anywhere reports it.*
 *
 * ## The rule this enforces
 *
 * **The catalogs own values. The oracle owns meaning.** Where the oracle does
 * restate a number — because the semantic claim is inseparable from it, as with
 * "a star tier is its own rung" — the two copies must agree, and this file is
 * what makes disagreement loud.
 *
 * A failure here is not necessarily an oracle bug. It means two sources have
 * diverged and a human has to decide which is right. Do not "fix" it by editing
 * whichever side is easier to reach.
