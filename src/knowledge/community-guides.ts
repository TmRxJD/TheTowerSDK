/**
 * The community guides this knowledge graph draws on, in one place.
 *
 * Player guides are the only source for a large part of what a tool needs to be useful: how a
 * mechanic is used in practice, what a build actually needs, where a threshold sits. None of it is
 * in a game file, and most of it is not on a wiki either — it is written by players who tested it,
 * and kept current by hand.
 *
 * They were cited one at a time, inline, as anonymous `ref` strings. That made the author
 * invisible: a compartment said "community guide" and the person who wrote it appeared nowhere a
 * reader would look. Collecting them here gives every citation a name, a link and a status, and
 * gives `thetowersdk/contributions` a roster to render.
 *
 * ## What a guide is and is not
 *
 * A guide is **attribution and framing**, never evidence for a number. It cannot be re-fetched by
 * a tool the way a wiki page can, it reflects one strong player's testing rather than the game's
 * own tables, and it goes stale as the game changes — the status field records that where it is
 * known. A figure supported only by a guide should be treated as unverified.
 *
 * The exception, and it is a real one, is a guide that can be checked. NanaSeiYuri's dissonance
 * sheet states four figures the package computes independently, so it is a source that can be and
 * is tested against — see `dissonance-matches-the-community-sheet.test.ts`.
