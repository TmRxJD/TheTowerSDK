/**
 * The whole graph, held to one rule: an objective node must claim something.
 *
 * On 2026-08-18 the graph was 290 nodes carrying 747 assertions, with 184 nodes
 * carrying none — most of it prose that `findContradictions` could never see and
 * that no wrong number could ever fail against. It is now 1473 assertions with
 * four bare nodes, and all four are `sentiment`.
 *
 * Sentiment nodes are bare ON PURPOSE and must stay that way: an opinion has no
 * fact to assert, and `coin-bonus-chain.test.ts` refuses assertions on
 * `economy.farmingAdvice` specifically. So this asserts the rule by claimType
 * rather than by a count, because a count would let a new objective node arrive
 * bare as long as an old one was filled in.
