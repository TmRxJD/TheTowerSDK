/**
 * The four plan families, held to each other rather than to the sheet.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * Every defect found in the last few rounds was invisible from inside the file
 * that had it and obvious beside its sibling: one builder indexing `slots`
 * where three others guarded it, one card lookup checking the store but not its
 * array, one family checking its levels before planning while three planned on
 * whatever they were handed.
 *
 * That last one was mine. The level schemas were written, tested, documented
 * with "check levels before planning against them" — and called by nothing but
 * their own tests, for three of the four families. Supported by the model,
 * never set by the wiring, reported by nothing: the exact shape this codebase
 * keeps producing, written by someone who had just spent a week finding it.
 *
 * A per-family test cannot catch that, because each family passes its own
 * tests. Only a test that asks *the same question of all four* can.
