/**
 * Levels are read from the catalog's own `level` field, never from position.
 *
 * The two are not the same. Most labs list level 1 first, but every Card
 * Mastery and the Dissonant Echo pair — thirty-five in all — list a **level 0**
 * row, free and instant, before it.
 *
 * Reading by position therefore did three things at once, none of which
 * failed loudly: it reported one level more than exists, it charged every
 * level the price of the one below, and it made the first level of every
 * mastery look free. A player with Super Tower Mastery maxed at 9 kept being
 * told to buy level 10.
