 * Effective Paths — what a workshop enhancement costs.

 * them from a table of eighteen stats at up to six hundred levels.
 *
 * Two discounts apply, and they stack multiplicatively rather than adding:

 * ```text
 * cost = table[level] × (1 − vaultDiscount) × (1 − 0.003 × categoryDiscountLab)

 *
 * The category lab is the Workshop Attack, Defense or Utility Discount lab, and
 * which one applies depends on the stat — the sheet picks it by where the stat
 * sits among its columns, which is why the grouping is written out here rather
 * than inferred from the name.
