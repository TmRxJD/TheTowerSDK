/**
 * The spill anchors, DERIVED rather than listed.
 *
 * `mirror_map` on the MCP resolves a satellite-tab cell to the planner cell it
 * mirrors, and it reads this list. The tool exists because a formula-mode read
 * of a spilled band comes back empty, so a `$AY$24` reference on a satellite
 * reads as pointing at nothing — which is how five controls stayed unwired
 * through an entire port.
 *
 * ## Why the list is generated
 *
 * It used to be hand-kept, with a prose copy beside it and a test asserting the
 * two agreed. They did agree, and they were both wrong: `eEcon Discount` was
 * recorded with one anchor and has four, and `eDamage Stone!BC3` was recorded
 * at a cell that has no formula — the real anchor is `BB3`. Two hand-written
 * copies of the same fact can only ever confirm each other.
 *
 * `scripts/effective-paths/scan-mirror-anchors.mjs` now reads every cell of
 * every tab in formula mode and takes the anchors the sheet actually has: 46,
 * against 15 recorded. Re-run it after a sheet version bump; it is idempotent.
 *
 * What is asserted here is therefore not "the list is complete" — the scan owns
 * that — but the properties a consumer depends on.
