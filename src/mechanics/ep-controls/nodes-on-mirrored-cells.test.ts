/**
 * No graph node may sit on a mirrored cell without saying that it does.
 *
 * A cell inside a spill window holds another tab's value. Modelling one as if
 * it belonged to the tab it appears on attributes a satellite's number to the
 * planner — the same confusion that had five controls looking unwired, pointed
 * the other way.
 *
 * This is only checkable now that the anchors are scanned rather than listed
 * (`scripts/effective-paths/scan-mirror-anchors.mjs`): against the hand-kept
 * list of 15 it would have passed by missing two thirds of the windows.
 *
 * Three nodes DO sit on mirrored cells, deliberately, and each one exists to
 * model the mirror itself. They are named below, so a fourth has to be argued
 * for rather than merely added.
