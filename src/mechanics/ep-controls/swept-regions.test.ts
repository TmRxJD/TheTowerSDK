/**
 * What has actually been read, as opposed to what has been counted.
 *
 * The control surface capture covers each tab's control panel. That is a
 * sample, and treating it as the surface is how "53 of 175" came to read like a
 * completeness figure. This file records the windows that have been swept cell
 * by cell, so any claim about a tab's total can be checked against how much of
 * that tab anyone has looked at.
 *
 * eHP, eRegen and eDamage are swept, each for a named window. eEcon has had its
 * eight modelled cells verified but its area not enumerated, and the difference
 * is recorded rather than rounded up to "swept".
 *
 * No tab is swept whole. Every entry names what it covered and what it did not,
 * because on this sheet the parts nobody read are where the corrections came
 * from — a mirror, two spills, and sixteen controls in an unread column.
 *
 * The eRegen sweep is why this file exists. Its panel had eleven controls wired
 * into the graph, and the sweep found `AL3 = {eHP!AL3:BM37}` — the whole panel
 * is a spilled mirror and eRegen has no controls of its own there. Wiring had
 * run ahead of reading.
