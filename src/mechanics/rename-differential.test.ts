/**
 * The numbers, after 620 functions were renamed.
 *
 * A rename cannot change behaviour, which is exactly why it needs checking:
 * type-check proves the symbols still line up, and the page still renders, and
 * neither says the arithmetic came out the same. Every expectation below was
 * read off the live site *before* the rename passes and pasted here, so this
 * compares against the old behaviour rather than against whatever the code
 * happens to do now.
 *
 * These go through the renamed functions on purpose -- computeLabGems was
 * calculateLabGems, computeModuleStat was calculateModuleStat, and
 * buildLabProgressRows lost its currency branch when costs became absolute
 * coins.
