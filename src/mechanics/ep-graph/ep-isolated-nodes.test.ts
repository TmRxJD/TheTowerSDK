/**
 * Nodes that record a control exists and nothing about what it affects.
 *
 * An isolated node is the EP graph's version of this repo's signature defect:
 * supported by the model, never wired, nothing reports it. It is not wrong —
 * the cell is real and correctly typed — it just answers "does this exist"
 * while the question worth asking is "if I flip this, what moves".
 *
 * The count is a CEILING that should only fall. Every one closed needs the same
 * evidence as any other edge: the formula of the cell that reads it.
 *
 * 41 -> 1, and the one left is terminal.
 *
 * The last five closed together, and the reason they held out is worth keeping:
 * every one of them is read on a DIFFERENT TAB from the one that shows it. The
 * satellite tabs — `eDamage Stone`, `eDamage Coins`, `eEcon Discount`,
 * `eEcon Stones` — spill the planner's control panel into themselves and read
 * the switches there. Searching the tab a control appears on cannot find them,
 * and searching harder would not have helped.
 *
 * Two things made that band invisible. A FORMULATEXT read of a spilled cell
 * returns empty, so the mirror looks like a reference to nothing; only a value
 * read shows the panel. And `eEcon Discount` spills at a ONE-COLUMN OFFSET, so
 * the letters do not carry across.
 *
 * The test below outlived that: an isolated node must say WHERE it was looked
 * for. "Not wired yet" and "searched four bands and it is not there" are
 * different claims, and only the second is a finding — this is what turned the
 * last five from a backlog into a question with an answer.
 *
 * One node is TERMINAL by nature rather than unwired. `authorDisclaimer` is a
 * drawing over the path table; nothing can read it, so it will never gain an
 * edge and should not be counted as work outstanding. Declared below, because
 * "cannot have one" and "does not have one yet" are different states and a bare
 * count conflates them.
