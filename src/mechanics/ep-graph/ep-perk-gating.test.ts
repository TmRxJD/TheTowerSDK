/**
 * Every eDamage perk is gated by the Perks master, and the graph says so.
 *
 * The five per-ultimate perk toggles are never read alone. Each appears inside
 * an `AND` with `AY61`, the Perks master:
 *
 *     AX5   STAT_UW_DW_FINAL_QTY(...,  AND($AY$67, $AY$61))
 *     AV6   STAT_UW_CL_FINAL_DMG(...,  AND($AY$70, $AY$61))
 *     AX7   STAT_UW_SM_FINAL_QTY(...,  AND($AY$61, $AY$69))
 *     AV8   STAT_UW_SL_FINAL_DMG(...,  AND($AY$61, $AY$68))
 *     AX10  STAT_UW_ILM_FINAL_QTY(..., AND($AY$61, $AY$71))
 *
 * A model that reads the perk toggle without the master reports a perk as
 * active while the panel has perks switched off — the stat moves, the sheet
 * does not, and the difference looks like a formula error somewhere else.
