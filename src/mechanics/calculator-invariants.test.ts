/**
 * The declared calculators' invariants, checked against the real functions.
 *
 * Each calculator states its range in prose, as an `invariants` list on its
 * registry spec. The claim under test was Hubstrate's: that such declarations
 * become generated tests run by the runner that already exists, rather than by
 * a sandbox nobody has threat-modelled. This is that claim, done by hand once,
 * to find out whether the invariants are writable and whether they are TRUE
 * before a generator is built on the idea.
 *
 * The declarations were read from `.acs/calculators.json` when this was
 * written. That file was a second, lossier copy of `calculators/registry.ts`,
 * which tower-mcp already serves through `calc_list` / `calc_describe`, and it
 * is gone — the calculators belong to the Tower MCP, not to ACS. The findings
 * below stand; only where the prose is read from changed.
 *
 * ## The answer, up front
 *
 * Writable: yes, and quickly — the range is usually the first thing you know
 * about a formula. True: **not always**, and the false ones were the point.
 * Three of the eleven had an invariant that the real function violates, and
 * every one was written from the handle's name rather than from the body:
 *
 *   - `CALC.LAB_COIN_DISCOUNT` "returns a multiplier in (0, 1]" — it returns a
 *     discount FRACTION, `level * 0.003`, which is 0 at level 0 and not a
 *     multiplier at all.
 *   - `CALC.MODULE_LEVEL_LIMIT` "returns a whole number in [0, 300]" — it
 *     returns whatever number the cell holds, so a cell reading `500` yields
 *     500.
 *   - `CALC.EFFECTIVE_DAMAGE` "is finite and at least 0 for any config the
 *     schema accepts" — a Project Funding module with zero cash produces `NaN`,
 *     through `log10(0)`. Reachable: the module equipped, before any cash.
 *
 * That is the useful outcome. An invariant written from the name and then
 * checked is a cheap way to discover you had the wrong idea of the formula —
 * which is exactly the failure the registry exists to prevent, caught one layer
 * earlier and for about a minute of work each.
 */

/**
 * The eleven this file checks, named by the SYMBOL each one calls.
 *
 * These were declared a second time in `.acs/calculators.json`, in ACS's own
 * shape, while `calculators/registry.ts` already held all eleven with the same
 * `because` and near-verbatim invariants plus params, returns, reads, produces
 * and the sheet function each mirrors. That copy is gone; this reads the
 * registry tower-mcp itself serves through `calc_list` / `calc_describe`.
 *
 * Keyed by symbol rather than by id, because the symbol is the thing this file
 * actually imports and calls — an id could be renamed without the assertions
 * below noticing, and then they would check a different formula's invariant.
