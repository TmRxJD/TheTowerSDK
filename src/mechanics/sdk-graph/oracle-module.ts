/**
 * Lift the knowledge oracle into the SDK graph as the `oracle` module.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The repo kept two graphs and only one of them was visible to the trust and
 * coverage layer. The oracle held 236 nodes about how the game behaves; the SDK
 * graph held 24 about how the Effective Paths spreadsheet computes. Coverage
 * inventories reference SDK graph ids, so 269 of 284 inventory rows read
 * `unmodeled` — not because the knowledge was missing, but because nothing had
 * ever joined the two. "5% modelled" was a wiring fact reported as a knowledge
 * fact.
 *
 * This is the join, and it is deliberately one-directional: the oracle stays
 * the place mechanics knowledge is written, and this lifts a read-only
 * projection of it. Nothing here writes back.
 *
 * ## What is NOT lifted, and why
 *
 * **Edges.** Oracle edge kinds (`scales`, `caps`, `independentOf`,
 * `appliedBefore`, `memberOf`, …) do not map onto SDK edge kinds (`reads`,
 * `gates`, `prices`, `displays`, …) without inventing relationships. An
 * `independentOf` edge — the oracle's most valuable kind, because it records a
 * relationship that does NOT exist — has no SDK equivalent at all, and forcing
 * it to `reads` would assert the opposite of what it says. Nodes are what
 * coverage needs; edges would be fabricated structure.
 *
 * **codeSymbols.** `implementedBy` names real exports, but 320 of the 336
 * distinct symbols are absent from `debug-graph.v1.json`, which the
 * `code-symbol-missing-debug` invariant checks at error severity. Emitting them
 * would fail every strict load. The symbols are not wrong; the debug graph is
 * narrower than the oracle. Until it is regenerated over the knowledge
 * compartments, `oracleNodeId` carries the provenance instead — see the field
 * comment in `schema.ts` for why that is not a downgrade.
