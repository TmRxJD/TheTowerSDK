/**
 * The ordinary-enemy spawn chances the Enemy Stats calculator displays.
 *
 * `waveInfoSpawnChances` derives fast, tank and ranged from a tier weight,
 * takes a protector chance, and gives basic whatever is left:
 *
 *     basic = Math.max(0, 100 - fast - tank - ranged - protector)
 *
 * That `Math.max(0, ...)` is doing more than guarding a rounding edge. Above
 * tier 23 the four named chances exceed 100 on their own — fast, tank and
 * ranged stop growing because the tier weight table is capped at 13 entries,
 * while the protector chance keeps rising with tier — so the residual goes
 * NEGATIVE and the clamp turns it into a displayed 0%.
 *
 * The tests below pin that: not to bless it, but so the inconsistency cannot
 * keep being invisible. A calculator page showing "Basic 0%" is making a claim,
 * and at tier 21 the save fixture refutes it directly — 171,255 basics were
 * killed at tier 21. See `enemy-type-mix-vs-save.test.ts`.
