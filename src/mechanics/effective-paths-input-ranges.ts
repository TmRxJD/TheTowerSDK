/**
 * The valid range of every input an Effective Paths test may set.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A test account whose stats are at maximum cannot test anything that filters
 * or plans upgrades. That was not a hypothetical: the damage tab's
 * `Hide UW Cooldown` filter was verified against an account with all seven
 * cooldowns maxed, so the filtered and unfiltered tables were identical and
 * the check would have passed no matter how the filter was written — including
 * the version that matched nothing at all, which is the version that shipped
 * to that check.
 *
 * The lesson is not "look at the levels next time". It is that a harness which
 * does not know what a *valid, mid-range* value looks like cannot tell a
 * working feature from a dormant one. So the ranges are derived here, once,
 * from the same tables the model prices against.
 *
 * ## Derived, never assumed
 *
 * Every entry carries the `source` it came from, and
 * `effective-paths-input-ranges.test.ts` fails on any entry whose maximum is
 * missing. Nothing here is a guessed cap: a lab's maximum is the highest level
 * its catalog prices, a workshop stat's is the highest level in its chart, an
 * ultimate weapon stat's is the highest level its chart prices, and a card's
 * is how many level values it has.
 *
 * A range that cannot be derived is reported as such rather than filled in
 * with a plausible number — a wrong maximum would put the test account into a
 * state the game cannot reach, and every number computed from it would be
 * confidently wrong in a way nothing else would catch.
