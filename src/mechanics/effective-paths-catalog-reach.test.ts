/**
 * Every candidate resolves to something the cost catalogs know.
 *
 * ## The failure this catches
 *
 * A candidate is a **name**. The planners look that name up in the lab, stone,
 * coin and keys catalogs, and a name that does not resolve comes back with no
 * maximum level and no price — so the candidate is dropped. The path is one
 * upgrade shorter and nothing says which one or why it matters.
 *
 * The names do not always match, which is what makes this live rather than
 * theoretical: the sheet calls Chain Lightning's lab `Shock Multiplier` and the
 * catalog calls it `chain_lightning_shock_multiplier`, so there is an alias
 * table. Add a candidate, spell it the sheet's way, forget the alias, and it
 * silently never appears.
 *
 * So: on an account with **nothing bought and nothing in the way**, no
 * candidate may be excluded for want of a price. Every other exclusion reason
 * is about the player — a locked weapon, a maxed lab, a switch — and belongs.

 * A config with **nothing in the way**, which is what this file needs.
 *
 * A zero config is not it. On a zero account every weapon is locked, every card
 * is off and perks do not apply, so a weapon-gated candidate is excluded for
 * *that* long before anything tries to price it — and a name that no longer
 * resolves would sail through unnoticed.
 *
 * Found by removing the `Shock Multiplier` alias and watching this file stay
 * green: the candidate was already out for Chain Lightning being locked.
