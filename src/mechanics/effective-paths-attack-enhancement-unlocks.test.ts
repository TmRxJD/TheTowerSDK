 * `eDamage Coins!EF5` and the five gates that read it.
 *
 * Each gated enhancement candidate opens
 *
 *     OR(NOT(GTE(EF5, <threshold>)), …)
 *
 * and `EF5` is the running total of `WSPCOST_SINGLE_ADJUSTED_CUMULATIVE` over
 * the six ATTACK enhancements. It climbs as the coin path spends, so an
 * enhancement joins the board partway down the path rather than being on it
 * from step 1 — which a single up-front exclusion set cannot express.
 *
 * Tested here rather than through the coin sweep on purpose: the sheet blanks a
 * gated enhancement on ZERO of that fixture's 39 accounts, because the
 * generator draws levels high enough that every gate is already open. The
 * planner code would otherwise be shipped unexercised, which is the failure
 * this file exists to avoid.
