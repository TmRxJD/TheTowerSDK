/**
 * The projection that makes one drawn player legal on every tab at once.
 *
 * Checked here rather than in the capture script because the capture costs
 * about six seconds of Sheets quota per account, and the property being checked
 * — a lab shared by two tabs gets one level, within each tab's own cap — is
 * pure arithmetic that needs no network at all.
 *
 * The cap case is the one worth planting: eHP and eEcon both list
 * `Standard Perks Bonus`, and each block carries its OWN max column. Drawing a
 * level once and writing it to both is the obvious implementation and produces
 * a state no player can be in the moment the caps differ — which is exactly
 * what `effective-paths-fixture-sanity.test.ts` exists to catch, one layer
 * further down.
