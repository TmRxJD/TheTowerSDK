/**
 * `EPC_SYNC`, against the sheet's own array machinery.
 *
 * This is the one economy function that is a simulation rather than a formula:
 * it lays each coin weapon's cycle out second by second, folds each to its
 * per-phase average, and averages the product across the combined period. A
 * port of that is worth checking case by case rather than spot-checking, since
 * an off-by-one in where the uptime sits would still produce a plausible
 * number.
