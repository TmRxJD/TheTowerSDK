/**
 * Who this package is built on.
 *
 * Almost none of the knowledge here was worked out by this project. The Effective Paths formulas
 * are a community spreadsheet's maths; the save file's enum indexes were mapped by someone else;
 * a chunk of the earliest game data came from an older toolkit; the wiki pages are volunteers'
 * writing. The package translates that work into TypeScript, which is a much smaller thing than
 * producing it.
 *
 * So the roster is data, exported from the package, rather than a paragraph on a website. Anything
 * built on this can render the credits it is actually using, and a name cannot quietly go missing
 * from a redesign.
 *
 * `CONTRIBUTIONS` is the whole list. The per-area constants it is assembled from stay where the
 * work they credit lives — {@link EFFECTIVE_PATHS_AUTHORS} beside the formulas,
 * {@link WIKI_CREDIT_SOURCES} beside the wiki reader — so adding a source means adding a credit in
 * the same file rather than remembering a second one.
